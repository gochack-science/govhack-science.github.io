What have we here?
This is a simple, fast, lightweight mapping system. It harvests available datasets from Tasmanian State and Local Government authorities and provides basic viewing and information retrieval.
Whose data?
The map supports GeoServer WMS/WFS and ESRI REST services. If you have one and want to get it in here, get in touch. Currently the map supports data from the following sources:
The LIST
Glenorchy City Council
City of Launceston.
Who did this?!
This mapping system was put together by Alex Leith for GovHack 2016. You can contact him at alexgleith (at) gmail.com
Why doesn't it do X?
Because I built it in a weekend! If you think it should do more, come and chat about it at GitHub. You can either submit a pull request or create an issue.
