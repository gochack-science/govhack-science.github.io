KrowdKwiz is a multiplayer quiz night in your own home – or at the pub, or in the park.
Register a Kwiz and invite your friends. When you’re all ready, start the game and let the fun begin.
KrowdKwiz is like a TV quiz show where everyone answers each question. And once all the answers are in, everyone gets to vote on the answer they think is the best.
Start a conversation, bring on the laughs  - Sometimes it's better to be funny than accurate.
Get points for being right. Get points for being better than right!
