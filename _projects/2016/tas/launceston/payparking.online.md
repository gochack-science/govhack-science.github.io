A mobile app to consume councils parking bays geojson and to provide simple mobile payment for parking bay within the time limit set by the council. Not eliminating the existing parking meters solution, nor jobs of the inspectorsÂ but extending it on top of it - giving the councils, like Launceston city, a potential to offer additional payment options without the need of upgrading existing parking meters for credit card payments.
