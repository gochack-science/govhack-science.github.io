Concept: To provide an easily interpreted visual representation of not only rainfall, but also the impact of the rainfall on the landscape, the potential of flooding and highlight any immediate and also impeding threats to persons and property, 
 
> Roads and bridges
> Walkways
> Businesses
> Residential areas
 
The system will not only display present coverage, but also utulising predictive modelling, will give an approximate indication of future coverage, and alert residents and businesses to any immediate threat or impedance.
 
The system will in addition to providing an easily interpreted GUI, will also link to SMS alerting and potentially an app, that users can even tailor specific alerts, for region or district.
