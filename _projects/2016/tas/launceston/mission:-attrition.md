In Mission Attrition you play as a university lecturer trying to get as many of your students to pass your course as you can.  You are dealt a class of students with different factors that will influence their chances of success.  You have a limited amount of resources which you can assign to individual students to improve their chances of success.  You'll have to judge for yourself which factors are most likely to impact your students' chances and offset them accordingly.
When researching the game, we were surprised at the number of factors that influence the chance that a student has of dropping out of their class.We wanted to shine a light on this and highlight some of the real choices that teachers have to make when allocating limited resources.To do this, we have made use of the Higher Education Attrition Rate data which shows how attrition rates vary across a number of variables.  We've cross references this with attrition rate data data for specific locations so we can adjust the chances of your students success based on multiple factors including the subject they are learning, where they are learning it, their gender, age, whether they are indigenous and whether they are disabled.
