We are Team Bit Byte Bit from Perth, Western Australia. At the 2016 Australian GovHack competition, we have taken the direction of crunching data obtained from Main Roads Western Australia, Bureau of Meteorology and Insurance Commission of Western Australia. Our aim is to produce an analysis report on Western Australia's motor vehicle accident rate based on traffic volume, weather conditions and motor injury insurance data.
We dwell into:
1. Correlation between Rainfall and Traffic Incidents
2. WA Traffic Incident with No Rain
3. WA Traffic Incident with Heavy Rain
4. Kwinana Freeway Analysis
