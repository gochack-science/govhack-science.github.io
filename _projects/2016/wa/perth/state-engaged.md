Our Hypothesis: Most West Australians feel disengaged with State and Local Government / Council spending and planning initiatives. 
Project “State Engaged” will provide a virtual 3D platform that enables Government and Local Bodies to engage with rate payers on current initiatives. It’s an interactive, visual platform through which residents will have an opportunity to explore, compare and participate in planning initiatives.​​​​​​​
The Minimum Viable Product (MVP): Is a simple but visually powerful platform that replaces Budget Papers, Master Plans and Infographics. It allows the user to scan the whole State, be informed and provide input, very quickly.
Features:
Visitors to the platform will be able to:
·        explore State Initiatives
·        explore and compare Local Council spending
·        have quick access to more detailed information sheets
·        join in discussions
 Stage 2: As more data becomes available, proposed initiatives could be incorporated. The platform could also be expanded to seek community feedback and even vote on proposed initiatives.
Why?
There’s a growing movement to re-establish connections with our neighbours and build a sense of community. Initiatives such as local farmers’ markets, community gardens and social networking sites to connect with your neighbourhood are growing in popularity.
State and Local Governments have an opportunity to be part of this movement and become part of the communities they serve.
Visibility of projects being undertaken by State and particularly Local Governments is poor and the majority of people polled in our survey do not feel connected to these projects. Seventy-six per cent stating they feel they do not the opportunity to provide input into Local Government investment decisions.
Project “State Engaged” maximises the benefits of the technology available to engage residents at a local level.
