Career Move is an interactive website that tracks and compare’s regions based on the economic performance over time of 19 Australian industry sectors.  It allows early indication of performance trends and is intended as a decision-making aid for international and local investors and people considering relocation.  It provides information on investment options and an investment opportunity and warning system as sectors grow and shrink.
It uses the Dept Employment, Dept of Industry, Innovation and ABS datasets. Future development would involve increasing the amount of data to create a prediction system by capturing spatial economic trends and patterns.
This system’s aimed at:
Migrants:             Know which regions they should consider.
Students:             which field to study.
Unemployed:      focussing effort for job applications.
Partners of people on the move: will I get work in that region.
Government:      to compare regions.
Businesses:         Health of industry in region.
Investors:            Investment option map and warning system.
