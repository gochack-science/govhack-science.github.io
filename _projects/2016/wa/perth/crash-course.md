This project aims to discover the relationship between congestion and the type of accident that occurs under specific traffic conditions. By analysing the MRWA 2011 to 2015 Crash Data and Network Operations Traffic Data, we hope to inform the public and government of the most statistically probable traffic risks for certain levels of congestions.
