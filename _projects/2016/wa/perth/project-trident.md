Project Trident uses a multi-pronged approach (incorporating both hardware and software solutions) that aims to: 

improve water time safety


inform beachgoers of the risks associated with marine activities


decreases the need to engage in shark control programs such as drum lines

Project Trident recognises that the danger posed by sharks (and the public perception thereof) is a complex issue with no one individual solution.  Instead, our approach is about using a collective group of strategies and activities in order to keep beachgoers informed and make their own decisions.
 
Be informed - not alarmed
