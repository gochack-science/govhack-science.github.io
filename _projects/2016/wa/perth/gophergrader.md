The Gopher Grader (http://gophergrader.co) and Policy Simulator (http://policysimulator.com) are both applications that help different segments of the community understand the community they are in and the value their government and it's policies provide.
The Gopher Grader is aimed at the wider public so that they can see how their area compares in a very simple way to the wider community. It provides a radar chart and a very simple grading system to show how their area compares on safety, culture, accesibility, services, community, and apocalypse readiness.
The Policy Simulator uses the same metrics to allow policy makers and the wider public to see how changes in different "levers" could impact the future of their community.
We have used a variety of different data sets ranging from statistical data to geospatial data to help create the different grades. We used statistical data to allow us to compare different communities, spatial data to get an idea of what the different communities are, and regression analysis to help us determine what could be appropriate levers.
In the future we hope we could do further analysis on more datasets and also get more refined and higher resolution data to provide even greater insights into a community. We also believe with higher resolution data we could provide even greater insights on how potential policies policies could impact both negatively and positively on a community.
