Our project ''iHero" is a web application that uses facial recognition to search Australian service photos across various conflicts as captured by the State Library of Western Australia,  Australian War Memorial, National Archives of Australia and the State Library of Queensland.
To use iHero, you upload a photo to do your search. The application will then use facial analytics to determine which photos from the various libraries match yours.
Search results include:
The matching images with a bounding box to indicate the person matched against (for images with multiple people)
The match confidence (eg 90%)
Detected characteristics (gender, glasses, smile, age)
The images and locations collected include market place, army base photos, casual and studio portraits.
Do you have family that served in World War 1? Do you look just like the photo of your family that served?  Give iHero a try and find out!
