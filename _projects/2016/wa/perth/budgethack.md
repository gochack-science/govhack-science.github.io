#BudgetHack is project undertaken by Perth Urbanist for GovHack 2016. The aim of our project is to use data from the Department of Local Government and Communities' MyCouncil and the Department of Industry, Innovation and Science's Region Innovation Data to explore corrolations between what local government spends its money on and the rate of return in terms of measures of innovation.
Matt and Peter Rogers are brothers who have grown up in Mandurah, Western Australia. The Rogers' are undertaking this project on behalf of Perth Urbanist, an organisation of which Matt is a co-founder. Matt and Peter are committed to community enhancement, creating sense of place and helping people understand, experience and enhance their involvement with their cities and community.
