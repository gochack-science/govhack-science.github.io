A mobile application that allows a user to choose two WA towns and view the rest stops and distances between them. Intended to allow drivers undertaking large journeys to better plan their trip in order to minimise fatigue and improve road safety.
Data used comes from theÂ Road Stopping Place (MRWA-513) dataset, and uses the GPS locations of the rest stops in addition to pre-chosen routes between the cities in order to generate a line-based visual representation of the distance between two chosen locations, and how the rest stops are spaced over that journey.
