We know that Melbourne is the most amazing place to live (despite what everyone else thinks). But how can we use government data to prove this amazingness to our visitors?
What if, rather than consulting the tourist maps, visitors could learn about Melbourne through a fun quiz game to gain points as they explore features of interest around our city?
Melbourne is a interactive city, so we don't want to just show visitors the historic attractions - we want to share the recent news about what's been going on near them so that they know where all the interesting stuff is.
For our regional areas, Melbourne has a diverse ecosystem of flora and fauna, so we thought we'd share this with our visitors by throwing in some fun animal questions generated from nearby animal sightings in The Atlas of Living Australia.
Hacks:
Smartphone map showing Melbourne's Features of Interest dataset
Generate questions (using existing NLP libraries) based on recent news articles and Atlas of Living Australia.
Convolutional Neural Networks to recognise photos of key landmarks
Biz Pitch (if only we had more time...):
Gamification of exploration by offering rewards for exploring, answering questions about local news / animals, and taking photos. (Rewards could include emojies, stickers, and credits and discounts at Melbourne's hidden cafes and other local gems)
Share local news articles with your friends to work together to answer questions generated from news articles.
Code Reuse Credit:
We used the following Open Source question generator: "Question Generation via Overgenerating Transformations and Ranking" by Michael Heilman and Noah A. Smith http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ark/mheilman/questions/
