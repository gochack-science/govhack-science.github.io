Negative gearing is a controversial issue.
The government has stated the economic benefits from negative gearing are necessary for economic growth. The opposition have argued that negative gearing only benefits the wealthy. The Greens, on the other hand, have stated that negative gearing should be scrapped altogether to improve housing affordability and Australia’s budget position.
The problem 
Negative gearing has sadly become a convoluted abstraction for the average Australian. The discussion is distorted by electoral ephemera and entrenched political biases. Three questions remain. What does negative gearing in Australia look like? Will Australia’s demographic influence the rate of negative gearing? Where do I sit in the picture?
The solution 
Changing Gears are taking newly released ATO data and presenting the information in a way that answers burning questions and debunks myths for the average person.  Our solution also aims to help the individual understand where they sit in the big picture.
