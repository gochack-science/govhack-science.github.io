Crowdfunding and crowdsourcing are proving to be great ways to utilize the economy of scale to affect change – be that local, state or federal government, charity organisations or the lives of individuals. Everybody can make a change for good, but some don’t know how. This is where Helping Hand comes in; utilising the idea of crowdsourcing, data analytics and big data visualisation to understand what charities, causes and community challenges need assistance and where volunteering resources can be best spent.
The inclusion of open data allows a real-time understanding of what causes are being affected by the actions of the Helping Hand platform, allowing government and volunteer organisations to understand what causes the Australian, state and local communities are interested in, and as a by-product, what they aren’t interested in supporting. Using analytics, these groups are positioned to make larger differences for the causes they care about.
Quantifying data into meaningful information allows users of the platform to understand what is happening in their local, state and national environments gives them the power to make meaningful decisions about how they can spend their valuable volunteering time. Quantifying various data sets allows searchability for users to be able to find activities, which will have the biggest impact on the causes they care about.
Giving the user this transparency, control and understanding in their environment means that whenever the data is refreshed, the effects of the users’ Helping Hand activities are made clear and real.
