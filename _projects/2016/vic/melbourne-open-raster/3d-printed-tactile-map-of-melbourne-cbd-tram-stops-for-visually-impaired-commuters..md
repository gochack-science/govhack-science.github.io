A tactile map for blind and visually impaired travellers. This map shows the Melbourne CBD, with tram stops overlaid from PTV's data. Tram stops are spikes that protrude above the level of the surrounding buildings to make them easier to feel. The map has a notch on the north-east corner to help orient it correctly.
