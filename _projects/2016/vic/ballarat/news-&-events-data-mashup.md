ABC News mashup is a web based application that presents a geo-spacial representation of the news and events in areas relevant to you.
Users are able to filter news and events by their intrests, this then populates a map with pin-point data of the news and events in locations that users are intrested in. Once the user finds a story that they're intrested in they can then follow through the link on the location point to view the source and find more information on the story.
To create ABC News mashup we hacked together datasets from ABC, Newscorp, Geelong events and IP Australia.
