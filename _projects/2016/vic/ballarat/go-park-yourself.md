The app will provide information about:
Safer places to park (CCTV and lighting locations)
Parking infringement hot spots
Probability of parking availability (according to historical parking occupancy data)
The concept also encompasses the potential for incorporating weather data to assist with parking location choices and combining tree location data with the position of the sun to inform drivers of shady areas to park in hotter weather.
