Project Overview:
Data Analysis Networking Knowledgebank (DANK) is a new way of accessing the Royal Commission into Family Violence Submissions. Improved accessibility and data visualisation have unlocked ways to easily explore the submissions to help better understand factors that reduce family violence. Meta data and text mining techniques have been used to help utilise that data and change the way the submissions can be compared to other government datasets.
Searching the submissions by distinct terms means that users can find submissions that relate exactly to what they’re interested in within seconds. Finding out that almost 30% of submissions refer to both ‘children’ and ‘alcohol’ or that 241 submissions mention the word ‘controlling’, is now a breeze. This opens the doors for researchers and professionals to access the submissions in new and exciting ways, uncovering factors in family violence within seconds.
Pinpointing the origin of submissions on a map of Victoria allows users to look at submissions and factors by location. This becomes increasingly valuable by also including local incident reports and where the nearest Domestic Violence Resource Centre is located. The map can also show just reports that relate to the users chosen keywords.
Using text mining techniques we have created meta data around each submission. We can identify people, organisations, addresses, emails, phones numbers, locations, and dates that each submission discusses. This opens up all sort of possibilities to collate the Submissions with other data sources.
 Perhaps the most exciting part of our application though, is that it can be used with all future Royal Commissions or any Government program that calls for written submissions. Our system will import the scanned pdf’s into the text database and they will be instantly searchable and plotted on a map of Australia. Increasing the value of past and future submissions easily.
Quick Start Guide:
Go to http://fullyregistered.retsim.com/
The main page is a search screen where you can search though all the submissions for keywords. Example: Assault
When the search completes, you can see the list of submissions returned. Clicking on any submission will give you the relevent people and dates (if applicilable) and a link to the actual submission pdf.
You can also click on the map in the header to show all submissions with crime data and domestic violence help centers.
On the map, Red = Submisions, Blue = domestic violence crime, Orange = domestic violence help centers.
You can filter the submissions on the map from the search screen by clicking on the "show on map" button.
