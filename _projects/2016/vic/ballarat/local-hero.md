It's hard to find stuff in Regional Australia, and whilst the data exists in an array of places, spaces and minds; an opportunity exists to help make this information more accessible. 
The project aimed to provide datasets available in a linked-data compatible manner with the view of being able to have information embedded within the datasets, more easily available.  An array of trials were performed around how to utilise available structured geo-data to enhance means in which this data may be more accessible for citizens.  A basic working geo-interface was produced alongside a presentation detailing the journey.
