MyTREE is a project based in the City of Wyndham, Victoria using the TREES datasets released by Council to :
provide the facility for offsetting greenhouse gas emissions by paying for trees to be planted in a local area and creating local jobs
purchasers of the offsets can name the trees to honour a death, birth or special occasion of a family member or friend
allows Councils and business organisations to offset in bulk their emissions
allows local residents to adopt and name existing trees in their area giving them a sense of ownership and responsibility for the trees
display in the map the trees that a person, Council or business organisation paid for or named
