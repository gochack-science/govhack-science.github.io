SmartPath - take a walk on the smart side with SmartPath, the smarter way to get from A to B
Project Description:​​​​​​​
To create an app for the people of Geelong that encourages them to walk more often by specifically finding walking paths that eliminate factors that are barriers to making the decision to walk.
Data story
SmartPath takes a user’s local data, such as location, time of day and the ambient light detected by their device, and combines it weather data from the Bureau of Meteorology in order to determine situations that could affect ideal walking conditions.
SmartPath then utilises a variety of datasets from the City of Greater Geelong such as location, time of day and the ambient light detected by their device, and combines it weather data from the Bureau of Meteorology creating a dense understanding of the local environment to make smart decisions about how to get from A to B that minimises situations that could affect ideal walking conditions.
the path with the most shade on a hot day, influenced by predicted shadows based on nearby building heights, and
the number and type of nearby trees or
a path at night with the most street lights, influenced by the number, type and lamp angle of Powercor street lights
People in smart cities deserve to walk smarter paths, and with the City of Greater Geelong boasting over 118 open datasets, Geelong is clearly the smartest city in Australia and deserves: SmartPath. With more datasets and Siri integration coming in iOS 10, the future of smart cities with SmartPath are endless.
Why this app is needed
Walking has health benefits
Walking is fun
Walking relieves the pressure on more expensive infrastructure
Walking results in people interacting with their environment and with other people, increasing social cohesion and connection to place
Why this app will be used
Australian Bureau of Statistics data from 2012 shows that walking for exercise was the most popular physical recreational activity, with females almost twice as likely to walk for exercise than males.
In the City of Greater Geelong in 2011, over 2800 people walked to work with trends indicating a steady increase.
Existing mapping applications get you from A to B taking the fastest or shortest path, but when you’re walking around a city, that’s not always ideal.
Increasingly people want to reduce their environmental impact and will seek simple ways to do this
