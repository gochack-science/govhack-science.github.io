Highway to the Danger zone is an interactive planning tool intended to help policy makers with identifying future trends for population, employment and travel demand growth and planning future development. In particularly the tool utilises Geelong City Council planning population forecasts and compares sub-region employment with labour force. Furthermore, public transport accessibility is shown for each small area. 
A Public Transport accessibility measure has been developed from PTV's GTFS public transport data on a small-area level to highlight shortfalls in accessibility, particularly in growth areas. This highlights the need for Geelong's public transport to adapt with the evolving population. ​​​​​​​By comparing the resident workforce with sub-region employment we have identified sub-region labour self sufficiency. Notably all sub-regions in Geelong except Geelong and North Geelong, have a net negative labour flow with workers travelling away from their dwellings. Overall this results in there is an imbalance of approximately 30,000 extra resident workers. These workers would have to travel to other employment areas including the Melbourne CBD to reach work, thus having considerable impacts for travel congestion. 
In highlighting the requirement for Geelong’s labour force to travel elsewhere for work, the strategic nature of the M1 Princes Fwy as well as the regional train network has been identified.
By superimposing flood prone areas, it can be seen that the M1 and train line is at risk of flood. Taking these links out of the transport network would have considerable effects for transport supply and result in latent demand. This shows Greater Geelong has a significant flood risk and would require further contingency planning for policy makers. Additionally, the correlation between high growth areas and flood prone areas suggests could result in significant impacts to gross regional product and livelihoods.
