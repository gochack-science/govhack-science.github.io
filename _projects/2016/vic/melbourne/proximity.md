Safety is a major concern for all drivers on Victorian roads. Accidents often occurs when people are distracted, not paying attention to the road or where conditions make it hard to do so.
 
Introducing our iPhone app Promixity. Proximity uses traffic and other sources of historic data to warn users when they approach areas that are high risk. Using data sets such as accident occurrences and bridge information from Vicroads, we are able to warn users before they reach accident hotspots as well as warn truck drivers in advance before approaching bridges that are too low.
 
Bridge Data
The accidents involving trucks running into bridges at Montague St demonstrate how a mobile app such as this can be used to avoid accidents. The user first enters the height of the vehicle, and the app will display all the bridges on the map that are to be avoided. If the vehicle approaches the bridge within 100 or so meters, an audible warning will be given.
 
Accident Hotspots
Using historic data we were able to find intersections and roads with high amounts of accidents. By entering this data into the app we can warn users before entering these higher than normal risk areas. By doing so, we hope that drivers will be more alert in these areas.
 
Other Data
We also have crime data, which will warn drivers to be more alert when entering areas with higher crime rates.
These data sets are only a subset of what we can use. We intend to use all data that allows the user to better understand the area around them. They can then choose which ones they are after and turn the others off. This includes but not limited to:
 
Tourism information
Stories (Heritage, war etc.)
Park data (locations, flora, fauna etc.)
Flood/fire risks
Weather forecasts
 
Our goal is to create a mobile app that will improve the safety for drives by warning them when entering higher risk areas. By using audible warnings, we hope that drivers won’t need to look at the phone at all. This will also allow the user to use this in conjunction with navigation apps.
