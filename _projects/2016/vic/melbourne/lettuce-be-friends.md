Food security is one of the greatest challenges facing Australia in the 21st century. In Melbourne, the challenges are exacerbated by phenomenal growth and expansion of our urban area into land that would have traditionally been used for farming. But not all the urban land is taken up. There are pockets of land in urban areas that are uninhabitable. These pockets of land may be powerline easements or flood zones for example - these cannot be developed.
This land should not be wasted. It should be freed up for sustainable farming that helps feed our nation.
Our project will help people to identify these many small pockets of land that can be used for farming and food production. It will connect people wih this available land so they can set up community farming projects and community gardens. The food that is produced in this area will be for the use of the community that grows it.
This project has the added benefit of bringing together people in the local community. It will connect people of different ages, backgrounds, ethnicities and religions over a common need - to sustain their families.
