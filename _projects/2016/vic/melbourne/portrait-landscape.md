Portrait Landscape is a machine vision portrait explorer for the National Portrait Gallery in Australia. Thousands of portraits are displayed on a single page and can be sorted and filtered using different categories. Clicking on a portrait shows users more information about the artwork, as well as related news articles sourced with the ABC News API.
Portrait Landscape is built on aÂ Python/Apache/PHP backend for image feature preprocessing, with a HTML5/JavaScript/WebGL frontend.
