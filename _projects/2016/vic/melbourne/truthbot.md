Truthbot is the world's first artifically intelligent automated fact checking robot. It scans Politician's twitter feeds looking for dicey facts or previously debunked statements, and automatically corrects the record by tweeting the relevant explainer article back.​​​​​​​
It uses data sourced from the ABC's FactCheck Unit, as well as from Newscorp and the Conversation. It uses deep learning to spot relevant tweets and the articles that relate to them.​​​​​​​
