The aim of this project is to provide an app that will allow people to plan a day outside. 
This app will provide people with the following information:
Weather (including advice for what to wear / need of umbrella, UV index etc)Location of parks and walking trailsLocation of public toilets
Some data will be sourced from existing databases, while others will be crowdsourced. For some data we may use a combination of both methods. 
We did not have time to fully implement all databases, so those that we did not have time to add to our app, but plan to use for stretch goals below are marked with an asterisk. 
Stretch goals include:
Accesibility informationAvailbility of disabled parkingDog leash rulesLocation of binsUser reviews/ratings of parks & trailsMobile coverageLocation of bins (will need to be crowd sourced)User reviews/ratings of parks & trailsMobile coverageExpanding the app to include the rest of Victoria and AustraliaEnabling the downloading of map data so the app can be used in mobile dead spots
