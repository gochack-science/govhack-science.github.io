SweetSpot is a data visualisation tool which combines employment, building, residential and traffic data in Melbourne to determine promising locations to start or expand a business.
It allows users to interrogate a wide range of property, landuse and demographic datasets at an individual building level, with the aim of helping users suitably locate a business.  The tool allows for the interrogation of:
- Building predominant use classification and current traders, this allows users to see who is currently trading in every building within the City of Melbourne, and quickly determine where their competitors are
- Building physical accessibility, which is a ranking administered by the City of Melbourne, based on ramp and stair access into each building. This would be useful in the case of a user who wishes to open a medical facility.
- Distribution of employment by industry (at city block level) across the City of Melbourne. This allows users to target specific sectors of the city based on the type of people who work there.
- Distribution of other traders by type (at building level), for example cafes and restaurants. Certain businesses would benefit from closer or further proximity from competitors and clients, and this tool allows users to identify such locations.
- Daily traffic volumes by individual road to help users gauge street exposure
- A Public Transport accessibility by building to help users identify premises which are easier for customers to get to. An index has been calculated for every individual building across the Council area, based on its proximity to train, bus and tram stops, as well as the service levels provided.
- Pedestrian counts by hour, across the day, to assist users in determing ideal trading hours
