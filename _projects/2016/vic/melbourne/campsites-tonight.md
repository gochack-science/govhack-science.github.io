Campsites Tonight is a convenient tool that allows Campers of Victoria a quick and easy way to find and book available campsites near them. 
Using the geo location of the user Campsites Tonight pulls the data of Vic Parks Campsites to find Available Campsites and sort them by distance. 
The booking portal is an easy 3 step process that provides an at-a-glance over view of the features of the Campsite, payment processing and booking confirmation. 
Campsites Tonight is modeled after the proven successful business models of hotel booking platforms providing a confirmed scalable solution for Parks Victoria to increase the ease booking process for travellers on the go. 
Team War Tapir love the outdoors as much as they love technology. Campsites Tonight is the perfect blend of the two. We hope by improving the booking process of Parks Victoria we will increase accessibility to help everyone to discover the beauty of Victoria.
