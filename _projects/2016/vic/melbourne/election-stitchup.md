Election Stitchup is a data visualisation project for the 2010 and 2013 Senate election results. We decided to work with election data but with a desire to represent it in a way that really stretched GovHack’s horizon - by crocheting the results.
We are using this dataset as it is available on the data.gov.au site, a major data portal for GovHack and indeed the data that partially determines who the Federal Government is!
