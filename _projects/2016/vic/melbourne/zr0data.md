Description
Government agencies such as Births, Deaths and Marriages Victoria have extremely valuable but sensitive data. Our goal was to find a way to explore this data without compromising one's privacy.
We took the provided dataset and stripped out details such as people's names and exact date of birth. This dataset was then aggregated and collated with other datasets so we could see which suburbs had higher birth rates, whether there was a correlation between birth rate and socio-economic status and whether or not more hospitals were needed in certain suburbs.
Difficulties faced
Provided dataset was small and lacked the information we would have wanted
Difficulty matching data with other datasets
Hospitals were not uniquely identifiable due to lack of primary key
