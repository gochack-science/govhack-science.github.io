Parks Finder is an app to make Victorian Parks more accessible to Victorians. It uses map data from Parks Vic, transport data from PTV, and Google's Machine Vision API.
 
Features
Park Finder lists walking trails throughout Victoria. It uses the PTV transport API to fetch nearest buses to the trails. It uses the Google Machine Vision API to detect landmarks and fauna in photos users upload while on the trail. The data includes certain fauna found on the trail (eg seals, bandicoots, etc).
 
As a bit of gamification, the app awards points based on:
- Actually visting the park
- Photographing certain fauna
- Photographing recognised landmarks in the park
