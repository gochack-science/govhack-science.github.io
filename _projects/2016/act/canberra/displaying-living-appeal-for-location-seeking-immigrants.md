We created this project with hopes to give a visual representation of the friendliest electorates for locating-seekingÂ immigrants to live in, based on social data gained from the latest ABS census data and AEC electorate results, then presenting it through Google Maps API using the Federal Electorate Geographic Boundaries provided by PSMA and hosted on data.gov.au.
