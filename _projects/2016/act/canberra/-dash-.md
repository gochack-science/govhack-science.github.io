"Bringing Government Data to Life"
-Dash- displays a high quality and curated dashboard that tells the story of Government and Australian data across key topic areas such as Energy, Finance, Health and Social. Furthermore -Dash- makes government data inclusive by allowing non-coders to search across government portals to interact with and visualise government data. 
It is simple to use and can be embedded in the data.gov.au home page.
So why do we need -Dash-?
-Dash- came from the minds of people who don't know how to code. Whilst searching through datasets on data.gov, we realised that not all of it was available in easy-to-use spreadsheets. Instead, we were confronted with APIs, XMLs, GISs, and a range of other file types that we didn't know how to open. Let’s be honest - most folk wouldn't know either.
This is a major barrier for users of data.gov.au: whilst the data is present, it’s not easily accessible.
-Dash- lets you:

Search through data.gov.au and and select the datasets you are interested in.


Interact with data through a number of embedded tools to enable more people to do complex analysis with ease. 


View curated visualisations to understand the story across a number of key topic areas such as Energy, Finance, Health and Social. 


Iterate. Play. Explore.
