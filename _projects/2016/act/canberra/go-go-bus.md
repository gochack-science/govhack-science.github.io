Go Go Bus 
​​​​​​​Now You can catch them all

 
Go Go Bus is a real-time bus schedule app, created by combing ACT Bus stop locations and the ACTION timetable data sets. From this, we’ve built a platform that shows you exactly where every bus is, in real time.
This solves a number of issues in regards to public transport use. From the 2015 report into our public transport network, on of the top reasons why people didn't use buses more was the fact that they were concerned that they never knew when they were actually going to arrive. The platform helps address this problem.




However, it doesn’t end there! Because we also want to increase the use of public transport in Canberra, which currently runs at only 6.4% of daily commutes, we’ve added in some unique features to get people out of their cars and onto our buses. With the enormous popularity of Pokémon Go, we’ve mapped out and included all the hottest Poké Stops and Gyms in Canberra. Simply open the app see where are and start catching! For the not so Pokémon obsessed, there’s also an option to see all the native wildlife habitats around town! Perfect for improving our tourism.










A 2015 survey of Canberra’s public transport highlighted that 68% of respondents said the biggest issue for them in not using public transport was their concern about busses not turning up on time and not having space available.
In future it could be expanded to that shows how many seats are left each bus! Much like the smart parking technology which indicates green light for space available or red if it’s taken, a sensor can feedback real-time information, so if a bus is full, then don’t worry about trying to catch it, you can relax, have another coffee and get the next one that comes.
