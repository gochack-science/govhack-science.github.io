This project analysed AIHW Youth Detention data and combined ABS Estiimated Resident Population projections to derive rate per 10,000 figures for indigenous and non-indigenous youth in detention. The data shows a stark difference in the rates with a decreasing rate of non-indigenous children in detention and  increasing indigenous rates (over the period 2008-2015), particularly in the Northern and Western parts of Australia. The results are presented within a 2D platform game that engages and challenges players with the population rates and presents possible solutions such as justice reinvestment. Levels in the game are ordered by the overall over-representation in each State and Territory. The project aims to educate, generate discussion about indigenous over-representation in the justice system.
