We are On Earth.
We want to help family, government, organisation and individual to plan for flooding emergencies, better prepared to reduce the damage of flood and save lives. We built a real time flood warning app, that puts relevant and easy to understand information into the hand of the user. Our Flood Watch app shows the real time flood warning on a map overlay, that individuals can timely assess danger and responses to flooding disaster.
We used and combined data from real time river height data from Bureau of Meteorology, static flooding risk from Geoscience Australia, and risk to flooding to houses data from IAG, to calculate and enable the finding of real time flooding analysis in a local area.
