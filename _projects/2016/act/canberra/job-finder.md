Team Digital is a small group of four ANU students who are looking to contribute to the community through using our skills in Information Technology. Our team looks to utilise data from the Department of Employment in order to help both new comers entering the job market and experienced veterans looking for new job opportunities. Since a career is a vital component of everyone’s life, this project will be useful to many people within Australia.
Project Job Finder is a web development project that will provide a mobile-friendly webpage that supports any device, be it phone, desktop or any other common household device, that will display information about jobs in regions and states of Australia. We will provide filtering to meet the users criteria and will eventually extrapolate data from third party reliable sources to provide residents of Australia with the ability to find the job they desire.
