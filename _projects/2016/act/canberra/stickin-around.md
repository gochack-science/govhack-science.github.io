What factors impact on a student dropping out? By linking in more information to the Department of Education and Training's Higher Education Attrition Rates 2005-2013 data, we hope to add further knowledge that could inform Universities of some of the factors influencing drop out rates.
We have used data provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics and Universities Australia to understand how these trends have changed over time.
