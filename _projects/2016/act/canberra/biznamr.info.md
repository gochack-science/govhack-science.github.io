Getting a new business name is a pain, because you need to do three different searches: check the Australian Business Register that the business name is free, check the IP Australia trademark database that your name hasn't been trademarked in your industry, and check for appropriate domain names related to your name.
Yuck!
BizNamr.help is a one stop shop to search for finding a new business name. With one search it will do all of the above for you.
The alpha version we completed over the weekend will search all three sources using the ABR web services, IP Australia's IPGOD apis, and a direct query for urls.
Our next version, partially completed, uses a short description of the business and machine learning techniques to refine the trademark categories and appropriate URLs. It will also use location data to suggest local experts who can help the business in the next steps of their journey.
