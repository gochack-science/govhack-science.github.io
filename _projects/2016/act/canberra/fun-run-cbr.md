We built a web app that plots local points of interest on a map. Users can go in, choose a start point and given the opportunity to select the particular points they have an interest in. After selecting a couple of markers and data sets, the app generates a route and calculates the distance for you to walk or run between them all. It’s kind of like a treasure hunt for Canberra’s cultural gems.
