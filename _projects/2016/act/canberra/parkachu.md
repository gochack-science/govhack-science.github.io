Parkachu is an iOS app that utilises the Pokémon GO API, as well as using the SmartParking and Canberra Bus Stops datasets to allow users to play safely while still having fun. They can see any Pokémon that are located near the parking lots and bus stops, as well as any vacant parking spots in each lot. The Pokéstops and Gyms are also displayed.
The 2 APIs that we have created are available:SPAPI: https://github.com/ninjaprawn/SPAPI​​​​​​​PGAPI: https://github.com/ninjaprawn/PGAPI
