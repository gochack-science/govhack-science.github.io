Problem: How do you know the value of your public transport network to your community?
We made a tool for visualising and evaluate the socio-economic value of transport for all.
Check it out at http://streetcred.azurewebsites.net/ or the raw shiny app at http://139.59.252.21/shinyapp

When we think about public transport services, we often think about things like fare prices, cost of services, the routes, and the on-time performance. These are all concerns for users and network managers, but they only provide part of the picture.
Unfortunately users’ additional needs may be overlooked, resulting in underused or inconvenient public transport services that make it difficult to travel from home to work, services and places of leisure. This especially presents challenges for disadvantaged groups.
For GovHack, we’ve chosen to look at Canberra as a small case study to investigate the benefits of integrating social and transport data, but the concept could be applied to other communities.
Our Story
This is the $treetWork$ team's first GovHack. We all share an interest in transport policy and seeking innovative ways to gain insights into how best to improve policy outcomes, and learning new processes to get there.
In $treetwork$, work is divided between two separate yet equally important groups: The analysts, who developed the app, and the non-analysts, who did everything else.
Check out our stories (and theme song) on the website - http://streetcred.azurewebsites.net/
Thanks to all the GovHack volunteers, data mentors and Canberra Grammar for hosting us! What a great event!
