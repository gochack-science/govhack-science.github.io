This project concentrates on interpreting and visualising IP Australia's rich data holdings to provide value to the agency and the public. 
Navigating the IP Australia systems may be daunting for applicants with limited to no experience with IP registration. We aimed to provide an intuitive tool which enables patent and trademark applicants in their choices, especially regarding choices around self-filing versus engaging an attorney.
Our analyses focus on matching applicants and applications to the outcomes of trademark and patent examination, and how factors such as agent representation & applicant type/size impact success. NICE classification, application types and geographic distribution also feature.
The interactive visualisations were built in Microsoft Power BI, published to the Power BI cloud service and embedded in a website hosted by Azure.
