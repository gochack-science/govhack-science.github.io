Project description: Opportunity knocks… but where’s the door? ​​​​​​​We’re making an interactive map showing where the job creation and industry activity is happening in Australia, region by region. Why? So that Australian jobseekers, industry and skilled migrants can see where the opportunities are, and policy-makers can explore geographic links between innovation activity and jobs growth.Barebones idea: Choosing what to study or where to move to access quality job opportunities is hard. Which industries are growing and which are contracting, and in which regions in the country? Wouldn’t it be nice if there was a searchable atlas to just show you what industry was hot in your region, or what region was hot in the industry you want to work in? Wouldn’t it be nice for a business to know where prospective employees were concentrated, so they could maximise the odds of getting the skilled workforce they need?
That’s what we want to build: a map that helps the right jobseekers and right industries find each other in the right places. Using open data on job vacancies, skilled migration, industry activity, innovation (R&D, patents and trademarks) aggregated at the regional level, jobseekers and industry can take a virtual tour of Australia, to see where the action is.
See the user personas in our Google Drive, including a school-leaver deciding what to study, a manufacturing worker facing redundancy who wants to stay in his region, a British nurse looking to work in Australia who wants to learn where there is most demand, a policy officer in the Department of Industry, Innovation and Science who wants to understand linkages between business innovation and jobs growth on a regional level, and the owner of a pesticides research business who wants to find skilled workers locally before trying to recruit overseas: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B5oH0VwQLxxRZXQzUF8xeWtFMUU 
Why this has value: Anyone who wants a decent job will be empowered to make informed choices about what to train in and where to live. Current and future jobseekers can see where they fit in the broader picture of economic growth and industry needs for particular skills in different regions. A school-leaver who wants a science career can see whether there’s a demand for those skills, and where in Australia she has the best chances of landing a job. A manufacturing worker facing jobs shortages and looking to retrain can get a quick sense of what job types are in demand in his region, so he doesn’t have to relocate his family.
At the same time, industry can see where the skilled workforce is concentrated, so they can access the people they need to be competitive.
We keep hearing that Australia is in the middle of an ideas boom, but people want to know where their existing skills will be needed, what new skills will be in demand and what the opportunities are in their home region. People considering skilled migration want to know where to start looking. A business opening a creative new venture wants to know where to open to access the skills they need to make their ideas succeed.
​​​​​​​By combining data on business activity, innovation and employment, our map can help match the right people with the right opportunities in the right place. It might also help attract more entrepreneurial and other talent from overseas. The map is designed to be searchable by region, skill level and occupation, to help people find their niche, wherever they’re from and whatever their background and interests.
The map can also help industry and policy-makers understand trends in innovation, economic activity and jobs creation at a regional level. It can be used to share simple visual evidence about what’s working in the economy, and where, to help develop better evidence-based policy, and to tell a visual story about that policy to citizens.
​​​​​​​Primary users: jobseekers, who want to know...

What’s out there?


What can I do where I am now?


Where should I go with the skills/interests that I have?

Secondary users: industry and policy-makers

Where are the growth trends happening?


How is innovation activity impacting jobs creation regionally?

Vision: what the future looks like with people using this map

The innovation boom has human meaning for ordinary people, and they can see where they fit in the story. They can see how to make the opportunities work for them and for their families.


Regional education offerings match the skills needed by industry in that region.

Graduates and TAFE students have better employment outcomes, because they sign up to learn skills for the industries that need workers.
 
NOTE: ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE REPOSITORY ON GOOGLE DRIVE - https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B2qu1C6SpN2banVObjZlVWwtbGc
NOTE ON THE PROOF OF CONCEPT UPLOADED: Images are static currently, however we also have them working on local deployments. We didn't have the time to link the maps in live. Calls to the data works, though, so if you select occupation or region, the data in the tables is correct. Titles aren't updating, but that is an easy to fix.
