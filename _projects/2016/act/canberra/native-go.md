Augmented reality for native animals
Educational
Active
Crowd source data
Gamification
Welcome to NativeGo. An augmented reality experience that allows you to interact in real time with native flora and fauna using your mobile device. 
Using data sets from the Atlas of Living Australia Native Go shows you all recorded instances of wildlife around you while walking along one of the identified tourist trails in the ACT, such as the Centenary trail. 
The app lets you interact with data specific to your location, as well as add your own photographic data to share with other community members. NativeGo allows for videos to be placed into the field of vision for informative or promotional purposes.
Sounding cool? The app can have applications in a number of fields including environment, biodiversity, education, tourism and health. The gamification element comes from the ability to share your own photos and see photos from other users in a real-world view.
From the site landing page the user can find information on how to use the app. You can jump straight in and explore what’s around them, or choose from a selection of suggested walking tracks.
Once you’re in the location you can activate the AR and start to view the world around you. You will interact with data from ATLAS and community members including images, videos and information about all the creatures living in your area. 
Now it’s time to meet the team:
Adam - serving up all your data animals
Tim W - user experience tour guide and design extraordinaire
Sherry - maps and code other super cool stuff
Leigh - wombat wrangler and app controller
Tim B - helping you talk animals to the rest of your friends
Al - strategises wildlife into the digitals and vice versa
​​​​​​​Kate - chocolate consumption support and videos
Thank you for watching. We are Team Oakton and we hope you've enjoyed the NativeGo experience.
