We Michael, Mohammad and Tylor. Our team is called D2S.
This is our first GovHack and we've had a lot of fun. We are a small team and have developed an ambitious idea. 
The Problem
Skill shortages have been affecting Australia's economy for years and are projected to get worse. The CSIRO Global Megatrends 2016 report outlined that labour markets will be reshaped due to new disruptive and innovative technologies. Four corners early this year spoke about the future of Australia's workforce. They stated that in the next 10 to 15 years, 40% of currently existing jobs will no longer exist due to technological advancements. They also noted that we are heading for a future that will have an increased demand for more skilled workers to manage these new technologies. Skill shortages are a difficult challenge to address, because skills are gained over years of education, not immediately. This means that being reactive to skill shortages does not work. To truly address this problem, the solution must be predictive. 
Societal Value Add
This concept seeks to address the skills shortage challenge that will be faced by Australia’s future workforce in 2030. The concept addresses this by analysing current employment, industry and educational data projections for the year 2030 as well as processing identification data of a university applicant to provide information on relevant fields of study that have promising employment opportunities for that university applicant. The formula can be seen below:

Introducing Boj.
Boj is an intelligent, connected, machine learning powered, data driven chat bot. Boj uses a natural language interface (IBM Watson powered) to interact with students. A student can tell Boj about themselves, attach their Facebook and Twitter, and provide documents that Boj can process. Boj will use all the information about a student, along with a large number of datasets (detailed below), to provide advice to the student about future education and career paths.
Boj is powered by insights into how the workforce is changing. These insights are provided by analysing data and building predictive models. The data is provided by the Department of Employment, the Department of Industry, Innovation and Science and the Australian Bureau of Statistics. This data can be used to determine which industries are changing. For example, this graph (http://i.imgur.com/zofH62f.png) shows the labour force proportion of three groups of industries: shrinking, minimal movement, and growing. These are the kind of insights that Boj can provide.
Boj will also use data from the Department of Education (Undergraduate applications/offers/acceptances, QILT data) to provide information related to graduate outcomes, so students can make an informed decision.
