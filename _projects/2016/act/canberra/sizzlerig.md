The 'SizzleRig' project involves analysis of bushfire data from national, state and territory governments. With machine learning tools we have developed a system for rating the threat of bushfire for any location in Australia that includes historical and real-time data from CSIRO's Sentinel HotSpots satellite programme and our beloved ACT Fire Feed.
Our SizzleRig web application is great for software-based bushfire visualisation, reporting, and management. But fire itself is visually exciting; humanity's great perennial friend and foe, so we decided to visualise and manage fire in a literal way through building the hardware aspect of this project.
Our gas-fed device is mechanically operated via an Arduino controller. A column of fire burns bright within a perspex housing, its height controlled by the software. It tells the story of our countrys relationship with bushfires over the past 15 years.
