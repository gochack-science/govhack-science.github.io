Staying the course is a visual analysis of data provided by the Department of Education about attrition data rates from 2005-2013.
This was created using Tableau Public and Powtoon.
Using this visual analysis, higher education providers can pinpoint areas of focus when considering entry requirements for students. Risk areas of study should reconsider entry requirements or support services to ensure that risky characteristics are reduced or mitigated.
