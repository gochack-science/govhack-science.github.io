Story Place is a collaborative platform linking communities with the history and heritage of the places they live and work. It is a place for everyone to share stories and to engage with existing datasets produced by government and cultural institutions such as libraries, museums, archives and historical societies.
 
Many Australians have a keen interest in the past and have stories to share. Australia’s government agencies and other cultural institutions have accumulated a wealth of historical data sets. The vision of Story Place is to provide a forum where individual stories and formal heritage data can meet.
 
Through an innovative use of a spatial database, Story Place will combine material submitted by communities users with material from cultural institutions, heritage management databases and other sources. Story Place is somewhere for all Australians to share and listen to each other’s stories in all their complexity - including local history societies, school students, older Australians, Indigenous Australians, family historians, heritage practitioners, academic historians and archaeologists.
 
In order to establish a proof of concept for GovHack 2016, The Data Explorers have focused on selected data sets from NSW and the ACT. Similar data is available for most of Australia, and the concept could be expanded to include the entire country.
