FireAlert is an app designed to utilise all the live datastreams related to bushfires in Australia to save lives.
The app combines live incident data from Queensland and NSW as well as the Australian Sentinel satalight data to detect when fires appear close to those with the app. Because internet access can be patchy, the app uses the last known location of the user and sends a text to them saying that a fire is close as well as providing informative information on the app's screen such as how close the nearest fire is.
The modern farmer and rural person isn't in one place anymore and often contractors and bush battlers are constantly roaming into new areas. FireAlert makes sure that even if people are not familiar with the area and it's fire dangers, they can be alerted quickly and have the opportunity to get out before its too late.
Getting out early is critical for saving lives.
Farmers can't be relied upon to be checking their phone every ten minutes to see if a new fire has arisen, it simply is too much of an interference. Thus, many farmers simply check fire warnings and maps in the early morning and at night when they get home. This is simply too little when taking into consideration the possibly devastating consequences of bushfires and the speed which they can arise.
Furthermore, the app allows those in rural areas to report fires around them. This information is then delivered directly to the Authorities so the fire can be fought earlier rather than later when it's too hard to manage. This turns anyone with a smartphone into a fire spotter allowing us all to work together.
A small spark can turn into a grassfire and then into a life threatening bushfire in less than an hour. FireAlert makes sure that if a fire does arise then those threatened by the fire, within a 50km radius, are notified so they can prepare and leave early.
This is one of Australia's largest problems and the data is out there that can help save lives, FireAlert brings in this data to empower farmers and the authorities alike.
