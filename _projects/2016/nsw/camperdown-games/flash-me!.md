We spend a lot of time waiting for things. From public transport, to waiting for family or firends, or even using the bathroom. 
Wouldn't it be great to have the opportunity to learn about things that you didnt even know that you wanted to learn about.
We wanted an app that could utlise these small bits of time, and gain something, just a little more. Learn about sciences? Animals, what have you.
 
Enter Flashme!
A flashcard inspired app that focues on short attention learning (be it a spare 5 minutes, 10 minutes). 
Simplified facts, with trivia style quiz. A fun way to learn, about anything.
To showcase this, we utilised data from The Atlas of Living Things, and created some fun topics to showcase this. Check it out.
 
This is of course not limited to trivia facts. Theres a treasure trove of educational information, such as on sources like CSIRO to showcase things people would be interested to learn.
 
A summary:
Topics and facts sourced from government dataset and resources (news, biology, health, geography, etc)
Focused on short attention learning (20 minutes on the bus?)
Ease of learning (its like a flash cards, short, interesting, funny facts?)
Reinforced learning (trivia style quiz)
User directed content (user rates questions, topics, and recommandations are made from that)
[Ending]
Got a spare 5 minutes? What are you waiting for. Give it a go, flash me too.
