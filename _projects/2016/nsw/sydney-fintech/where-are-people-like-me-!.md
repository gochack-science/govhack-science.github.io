New migrants find it hard to find affordable housing for rent as migrants are not familiar with local areas sufficiently to make an informed decision as to where best to live depending on their circumstances. We recommend ideal suburbs for their rental needs based on Income, Expenses, Gender, Age, Profession and Marital Status by comparing  with existing data as a benchmark.
