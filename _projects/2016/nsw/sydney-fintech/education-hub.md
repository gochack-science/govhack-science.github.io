Education hub - Helping students decide thier future.
Story:
Australia is a popular study destination with students from around the world wishing to gain a top-quality education. Each year, many new international students enrol in Australian courses and add to the already significant international student body around the country.
In 2013, 526,932 international students were enrolled in education programs in Australia. Of these, there were 231,186 international students enrolled in the higher education sector. 
There is a wide recognition that International students are a vibrant and important part of the student community in Australia. The factors that have traditionally influenced institutional choice are quality of education, reputation of university in the home country, international rankings, social media, word-of-mouth from close acquaintances, permanent residency, lifestyle, and employment prospects. Every university has support centres and dedicated staff to help them out once they arrive on the campus. But the tools to help them choose which campus they should choose are very disparate. This is because of the different drivers and factors at play in different countries and regions.
For example, ICEF Monitor reported in August 2012, that a study in China revealed that 65% of the time, the final decision with respect to destination country, programme, and educational institution was made by the parents. While students clearly play an important role in deciding where to study abroad, it is often the parents that have incredible influence over the final choice of study destination.
One of the major influencers are the International Education consultants, these consultants offer advice and support to overseas students wishing to continue their studies outside of their home country.
The aim of education hub is to empower the students and these agents by providing them an open access to not just the available data, but also clever insights from  all relevant datasets to make them better informed.
