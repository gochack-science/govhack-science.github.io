The project is a Hazard Communication and Alert system aimed at improving communication and responsein the event of emergency events involving schools, childcare centres, universities and other educational organisations. 
The application will allow students, parents, staff, emergency authorities, and transport authorites toquickly receive notifications in the event of a relevant incident affectingeducational institutions. A map in the application will highlight relevant locations - schools, police stations, hospitals, etc, as well as providing relevant traffic and weather data to facilitate clearer responses to crises. Transport authorties can use the data to facilitate emergency evacuations using existing infrastructure - nearby buses, for example.
The application will also allow schools to alert students, parents, and emergency authorities of a developingsituation, supplementing traditional audio based approaches. This willallow instant dissemination of relevant emergency procedures to studentsand staff, minimizing panic and confusion and drastically improving responses times.
The application will not only use existing data on locations of educational instituionsand hospitals, as well as live traffic and weather data; it will also provide an opportunity for the government to obtain new data on emergency procedures and practices,paving the way for improvement to such methods in the future.
