On The Spot provides you with hyper localised news items, weather details, traffic and other alerts and warnings. Unlike other news feeds it lets you know what's happening right on the spot you are. Our search targets events and content within a 1km radius of your current location.
Have you ever been stuck in traffic and wondered what's causing it? Or been in a place and wondered about things that have happed there in the past? By providing realtime events as well as historical news items that are about a very specific spot in Australia, On The Spot is fun, useful and educational.
In Augmented Reality mode waypoints are shown as you pan around. These points identify where local events happened relative to the spot you are standing.  Historical images can even be overlayed on your camera view to let you see what that spot looked like in the past.
Our data comes from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Content API, The Bureau of Meteorology and the NSW Government's Roads realtime feeds.
Our goal is to extend the layers of geo-coded and time indexed datasets to provide an extreamly rich and compresencive profile of every spot in Australia.
