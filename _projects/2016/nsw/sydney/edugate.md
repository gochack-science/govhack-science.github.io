Edugate Responsive Website: https://edugate365.wordpress.com
Edugate is all about identifying the vector of skill-gaps in the market with emerging students into the workforce, to help choose suitability of courses undertaken, TAFE classes chosen in the last years of high school and degrees applied for. This is to amplify student's chances entering the workforce with qualifications that employers are requiring, helping bridge the gap and minimise the chances of unemployment.
We see this as a critical problem that data can help answer. The rate of unemployment in students completing secondary education and tertiary education can be improved with prediction analytics and data matching of qualifications achieved through smart choices of the employment opportunities that are constantly in flux.
Using advanced data analytics with user centred filtering and sorting techniques, this product allows personalised searching and identification unique to students needs. This is then displayed in an easy to use, engaging dashboard surfacing the the information the job seeker is needing, in a mobile responsive webspace.
