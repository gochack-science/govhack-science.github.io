This project will explore combining the existing transport data sources with a new datasource that focuses on the human vs system aspect of travel in NSW. It will explore ways at looking at crowd sourced and open data where time isn't the only thing important about a trip - e.g. station congestion causing transfer delays, cleanliness of bathroom facilites - any element that a transport user might have postitive or negative feedback for that another transport network user can modify their trip to experience/avoid.
The presentation will expand on the concept and the potential use cases for it.
The practical example will focus specifically on crowd sourced data and station congestion - a rating system that uses a mobile application feedback system to generate data to calcuate a 'HEAT' score that can be used to give different weights to timetable route calculations.
