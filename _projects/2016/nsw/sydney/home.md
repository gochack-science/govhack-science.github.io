The goal of our product is to connect people with the type of suburbs that they want to live. When you think about your neighbourhood, there’s probably a lot that you love about it. Maybe it’s the time it takes you to get to work, the types of shops in the area or how easy it is to catch public transport. While current property services only account for suburb and pricing searches, HOME extends this to find areas to live that meet all of your requirements.
