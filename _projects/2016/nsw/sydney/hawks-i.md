Hawks-i is a “Disaster Management Solution” for the people of NSW.
At a high-level, Hawks-i comprises of a Processing Centre that fetches threat data from a range of publicly available sources (government, private, news media, social media and parent groups). It aggregates and analyses data real-time, quantifying the threat.An operator monitors a dashboard that gives a high level view of the impacted area. An easy to use app exists for the Operator, Parents and School Staff. ​​​​​​​
The dashboard shows the impacted area due to the threat, including the schools affected within a defined radius, the total number of students and staff in those schools. Estimations based off historic open data are automatically adjusted for the area of impact, providing capacity management on the fly.
Notifications are sent to the emergency services with a list of impacted schools, number of students and staff, and contact details. Affected schools and parents are notified of the threat, its severity level and an action plan from the emergency services.
