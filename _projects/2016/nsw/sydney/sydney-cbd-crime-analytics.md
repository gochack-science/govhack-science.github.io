We like trolling through mounds of data to see the secrets behind. We are data nerds and "Orange is the New Hack" is our team.
 
Our tool aids local council and state authorities, as well as layperson to learn about the safest times and places to visit in Sydney city.
Users can easily explore this mashed up data in an interactive and visual way, and find powerful insights into the relationship between weather and crime patterns in the Sydney  CBD, and well as common hotspots for crime and the predominant type of offences that are occurring in our city.
Through interactive data visualizations, users can investigate the correlations between weather and criminal activity. To resolve untold mysteries behind bad weather cause bad behaviour. This can help drive decisions in both policymaking and police resourcing, allowing them to predict the rate in incidents that may occur on a given day.
 
We dissected a number of dataset for this hack including historical rainfall and temperature forecasts from the Australia Bureau of Meteorology, Non-Domestic assaults and robberies in the Sydney CBD from the NSW Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research, as well as a Recorded Crime Dataset also from the Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research.
