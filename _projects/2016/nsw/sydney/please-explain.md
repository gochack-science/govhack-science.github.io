The Motivation
Following the recent increase in support for nationalist and far right parties in the recent Federal election - I wanted to look at Australian communities that, through the election, have shown the most concern about immigration.
I chose to focus on the immigration of Muslim people specifically, as this a current social issue that is challenging Australia's multicultural status.
Background
There is hypothesis that explains why people struggle to identify with sections of the community: Having no personal contact with them creates a distrust of people from different cultures or that hold different beliefs.
This problem is obviously made worse for Muslim Australians due to the geo-political state of the World and current spate of attacks by religious fanatics that claim to be Islamic. But how does this play out in an election…?
The app
This app uses a combination of PSMA Administrative Boundaries, Australian Electoral Commission 2016 Senate election results and Australian Bureau of Statistics demographic data to highlight the relationship between Muslim Australians and Australians who voted for One Nation, the Australia First Party & the Australian Liberty Alliance party.
Futures 
Improvements to this project would include adding economic and additional cultural demographic factors to explain voting patterns in more detail.
