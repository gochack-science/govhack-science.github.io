Tolls Board Game:
The Tolls Board Game is a virtual board game poking light hearted jabs and educating people about the poor state of sydney roads.
We are using the Transport NSW Roads realtime dataset to take travel time on popular sydney roads, using this to calculate cost incurred when another player lands on a player owned road.
We believe this creates a dynamic boardgame experience where skill and knowledge comes first and luck second.
