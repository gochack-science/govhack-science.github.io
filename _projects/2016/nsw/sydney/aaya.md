Pitch:
AAYA is an innovative platform which aims to reduce a parent's stress and costs related to childcare. It allows a parent to select a Childcare using information that matters to them and help a parent reduce costs by getting some form of refund  for their child's inability to attend a child care for various reasons. AAYA transform the inability into a vacancy which others can use and pay for.  This creates value for all involved including the economy where the concept increases the income of the stakeholders and creates effeciency in the sector.
Data:
The project has been designed using data available from Department of Education, Crime and Transport. We also used some data availabe via google maps but did not get enough time to integrate all on a google map and did not upload the Map feature. The data will be suplemented by getting Childcares centres and parents to register creating the business model around AAYA.
Demo Site: The site has been designed for Mobiles only. Please view in mobile. We did not get time to start the desktop version on put search results in a Google map view
