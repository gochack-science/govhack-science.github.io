The Lighthouse Project 
The Lighthouse Project merges information about crime, demographics, weather, land zoning and street illumination to provide a map of the safe and unsafe areas within a suburb.
The Lighthouse Project will provide information for city councils, police officers, city planners and policy makers to address solutions to specific problems.
The aim of this project is to make the city smarter, enhance local businesses activities and support a vibrant and safe Sydney night-time economy.
Before starting the project, our team developed a survey to identify the main factors that make people feel unsafe in the streets. This is the link to the survey: https://docs.google.com/a/student.uts.edu.au/forms/d/1zejZvgg6247G9BCDKj...
Only a small subset of data was used for the demonstration website. The area used was Newtown, NSW.
