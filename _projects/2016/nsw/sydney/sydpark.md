Finding street side parking in the CBD is one of the most excruciating experience when you live in Sydney. We are all familiar with not being able to get a parking spot close to where we want to be. What if parking is smarter? What if there was a better way?
SYDPARK will enable Sydney-siders to do just that by digitising street parking data to create a real-time map in a web application. Why street parking? Because this is the problem that causes a lot of the traffic congestions and frustrations around commuting in NSW (30% of traffic congestions are due to people driving around looking for parking - according to CISCO).
We plan to use the data (Access Features and Barriers in Sydney City) from City of Sydney, and additional data regarding street parking space from City of Sydney's website to determine the availability of on-street car park spots in the CBD. 
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
A developed end product will feature the following:
City Benefits
Increased revenue through improved capture rates and tickets issued for parking violations
Additional revenue from pricing changes powered by analytics
Higher enforcement-officer productivity and empowerment through the use of technology
Improved success rate in parking ticket disputes
Citizen Benefits
Reduced circling, leading to savings of time and fuel
Less overall congestion and general improvement in quality of life
Features
Citizens and visitors can:
Search for parking spaces based on point of interest or preferences (in real time, unavailable car spots will not show up on the map)
Receive voice guidance to a parking space
Make payments using a mobile phone
Parking-enforcement officers can:
View a live video feed of parking and no-parking zones
Detect and report parking violations in no-parking and loading zones via video
Administrators can:
Easily configure and manage the sensors and video infrastructure
Monitor the enforcement of policies for parking violations
City planners can:
Gather parking occupancy, revenue, and enforcement reports
Provide detailed information such as time of day, day of week, etc., to assist with pricing decisions
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
We would like to recommend the project be rolled-out in the following manner:
Phase 1: Relying on GPS technology to track the cars in the car spaces, users will connect through the web app/mobile app (registering their account and their car regisration number) and manage their car parking through it. (6 - 9 months)
Phase 2: Implement sensor technologies in the parking spots around the CBD to monitor the specific street parking space in a more accurate time frame. With the roll out of phase 2, all new cars will be required to obtain an SYDPARK account during registration. (9 - 12 months)
Phase 3: The final stage (depending on changes related to meters and paper ticket regulations), meters and parking rangers will be made redundant due to all systems being connected and tracked digitally. This phase will also include the rollout of the technology to other suburban councils. (3 - 6 months)

Cities around the world are already implementing technologies and converting into smart cities. Sydney can learn and build on what has already been implemented:
- Canberra: A new system aimed at easing traffic congestion and making parking more convenient is now being trialled in Manuka’s shopping and entertainment precinct. (http://www.act.gov.au/our-canberra/latest-news/2016/april/smart-parking-...)
- Westminister, London: Smart Parking installation connects sensors in the parking spaces to a central data platform, allowing drivers to see the availability of a space using an app.(https://iotuk.org.uk/smart-parking/)
- Dubai: Paying for your parking spot via mobile. (https://www.mpark.rta.ae/howitworks.jsp)

The possibilities and opportunities around bringing back Sydney's vibrance (because we have great festivals and events all around the city) by making it easier for individuals and families to drive and park in the city.
Its time for Sydney to move into the digital age and SYDPARK can be a catalyst for moving Sydney into being a city of the future. 
Let's make MySydney a Smart Sydney!
