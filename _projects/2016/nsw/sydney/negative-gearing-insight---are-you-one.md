In the last year, the topic of "negative gearing" has become a hot topic in both the media, political arena as well as daily conversations. It is a controversial debate where opinions vary on the impacts of whether it's a policy that should be changed. 
Legion has taken the govhack opportunity to crunch the tax data provided by the ATO with a focus on negative gearing. By using data visualisation, predictive analytics and causal inference; we will show some hidden insights via our webapp which visualises the population geographically and demographically and socialgraphically.
