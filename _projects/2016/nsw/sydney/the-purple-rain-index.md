Project Description
The Purple Rain Index turns individuals into insurance advocates by educating them about flood risk, through this process they learn about the risk for their close friends and family and can easily share this data.
Speaking to IAG a common problem they have is communicating the importance of risk before it happens. So we thought, what if we could turn individuals into a salesmen for their personal friends and family, that way the information is coming from trusted source rather directly from IAG.
How it works
We educate people by understanding what their perceived level of risk is. We do this by showing  a google street view image of location for friend or family member, and ask them if they think the location would flood. Based on their response we test how accurate they are via the IAG Flood Risk API. Individuals can then notify their friends and family of the results.
Long Term/Entrepreneurial Thinking
We think if an insurance company such as IAG was to offer some type of referral reward by using this tool. This would be a great lead generation tool that turns strangers into sales talent that not only gets customers through the door but also educates them at the same time.
