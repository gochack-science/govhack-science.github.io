There are 100,000 homeless australians. Getting back on your feet once in that position is extremely difficult. Unsung gives Australians without income the tools to be able to provide for themselves and not rely on charity or the government. This is done through a guide to using the gig economy and with a list of free wifi locations that are ranked by the utilities near the location e.g. health services, bathrooms, free food etc. We pulled in this information from open government data sources.
