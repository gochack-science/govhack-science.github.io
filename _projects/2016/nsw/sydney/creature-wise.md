The Atlas of Living Australia is a great resource for finding out more about living things in Australia. It is also an important resource for crowd sourced recording of wildlife sightings.  Unfortunately, many people do not know about Atalas let alone that they can contribute to it.  
This govhack project aims to increase awareness and crowd source contributions to the Atlas of Living Australia. We have created a twitterbot that will tell you what could be living near by. Simply tweet your location to @CreatureWise and it will provide you with an animal to look out for, a reference picture and link to the Atlas for further reading.  We also promote that you can contribute to the Atlas by letting them know when you have seen an animal.
