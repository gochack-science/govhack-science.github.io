School Disaster Resilience
Disasters especially bushfires can have a large effect on the australian community. Schools especially in rural areas represent very important points in case of a disaster because there may be large numbers of young children that require special planning from emergency services to keep everyone safe. It is also very important for the parents that they know that their children are safe and this is currently left to each individual school as the central department does not have individual students parents contact details.
Our applications goal is to assist in the planning and coordination with emergency services in times of a disaster and make schools more resilient! 
It visualized the School location datasets including Primary, Secondary and Early Childhood schools. These datasets contain the geographical location of the schools, a DOE ID, the name and type of school as well as the number of students enrolled and teachers.The user can then define a disaster and its radius to mark the affected area. This will list all of the affected schools on the left along with each of their phone and email addresses in order to notify them.When planning the response to a current disaster we thought it would be useful to display information about any other current disasters on the map as well. To start with we included Rural Fire Services Major Incidents feed. Each event is shown on the map with the title of the event and link to further details on the Rural Fire Services website.If schools need to evacuate we wanted to make it easy for the user to find suitable locations that could hold large amounts of students until they able to picked up by their parents or emergency services. We used the University Locations dataset for the purpose. Nearby campuses are shown in yellow.Each type of school, Primary, Secondary, Special Purpose/Other is layered on the map in a different color and these layers can be toggled on and off to help …
In the Details View we can visualize a escape route for this school and and bring the details of the current location into the Front. We also can see Details about a school and can contact them directly.
For Emergency Service it is probably suitable to Have all necessary Data in one place. For Example: We can List All know fire locations and can toggle them through the map by click. Then We can see how many people are affected and separate them into classesAlso, if we have the necessary data, we can display available Rescue Equipment and Resources. 
Based on the data we can Make calculations and Output everything into Rescue Plan where we know based on common procedures, how to distribute our Know resources. We also can map Additional Data like Predictions based on weather and Geolocation. School Disaster Resilience can also help people to monitor and react to disasters on different application platforms.we Currently consider 6 categories of users: Government Admins, School Admins, Teachers, Students, Parents, and General Publics.visual information such as the safety and reunion locations and routes would help teachers and students to get out of the danger zone.Status notifications would help the people far away to get first hand infos of the people in the danger zone when there are any hazards.
