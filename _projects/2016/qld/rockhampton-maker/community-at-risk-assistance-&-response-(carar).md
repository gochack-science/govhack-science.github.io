To combine a range of data sets relating to areas most at risk during a range of natural disasters (flooding, fire, etc), with demographic data on those most at risk within those areas such as the elderly and those with disabilities.
The aim is also to be able to link at risk members of the community with other individuals in their area who may be able to provide assistance/services in the event of an emergency situation.
