HubGap is for innovative Australians who are interested in tracking the changes in innovation within Australia or their State or Territory. The innovation search tool gathers data from multiple data sets to provide information about patents, funding expenditure/opportunities, industry employment, Digital Champions and start up events and activities throughout Australia. The website provides the client with key information relating to their industry and location via the search or optional social media feeds. The benefits for the communities and Australia as a whole will increase as more and more people look to develop and innovate in their industries. We are here to help people connect and stimulate ideas in their industry.
