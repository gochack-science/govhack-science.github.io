The community companion device is for the elderly, the disabled and the infirmed.  It will make it easier to engage people and for them to not feel so isolated and lonely.  Elderly people feel disengaged, and this idea will help overcome these concerns, by delivering data technology to people who want to use it, but feel it is too hard.  It will use single-touch technology and voice output.  Android text-to-voice service will be used to speak the buttons as they are pressed.  In the future the device will use Amazon Echo cloud-based services (see https://developer.amazon.com/echo) to provide more general question-answering, like Siri.  Ideally, it will also provide some conversational features so that it can be a companion to combat loneliness, like Hasbro's Robotic Cat companion (http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-35310200).
