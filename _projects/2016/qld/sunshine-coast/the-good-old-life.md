Background:
In Queensland, you are recognised as a senior citizen when you turn 60 and are entitlded to the pension when you enter your late 60s. However, at these moments in life seniors are not provided with useful information that would enable them to be actively involved in their community. Our hack provides a means for service providers and/or senior citizens to generate a printable brochure with relevant information about a local area.
 
Description:
Users access our website, type in a suburb and hit Submit. That's all it takes to generate a report with all the information you need to know about senior life in your community! Print out your colourful brochure and flip through the pages to find out information on:
Events
Outdoor Activities
Culture & Heritage
Community Groups
Education 
Where you can use your senior's discount card. 
 
Benefits
There is a wealth of open data available from state governments, local councils and not-for-profit organisations that contains useful information for seniors. The problem is, this information is not easily accessible (requires use of computer) and/or there is low awareness of applications that have been built to provide it. Our hack enables service providers such as Centreline and the Queensland Government to generate a brochure that can be posted in the mail to new and existing Senior Citizens.
 
Data Story
We've combined open data from the Queensland Government, Sunshine Coast Council, Noosa Shire Council and the Council of the Aging. We have plotted these datasets which enables us to query them against a particular senior person's address. This could be done with all state and local government datasets, and time constraints were the only thing stopping us from making this an Australia-wide application.
