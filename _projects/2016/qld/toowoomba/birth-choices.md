An app to enable parents informed choice in their place of birth. Parents log their postcode, and an infographic to display hospital data in their local area around normal birth rate, cesarean section rate, length of hospital stay, continuity of midwifery care, waterbirth, epidural, visiting access for private midwives in order to compare and contrast and match their needs and desires for birth with the supporting facility. This will ensure greater choices, understanding and satisfaction around place of birth and ensure more accountability in the care and services facilities provide. 
There are around 300,000 births per year in Australia, around 60,000 births per year in Queensland, so this app could be of huge benefit to a large portion of our population.
