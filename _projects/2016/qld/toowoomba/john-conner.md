The John Conner project was initiated by the Toowoomba Trio to tackle a major and growing problem faced by Qld vegetable growers. This challenge is Identifying and responding to heat stress in their crops.   High temperatures can cause considerable stress to crops, reducing yields and the quality of the produce grown.  However, if the stress is identified early enough remedial action can be taken to minimise the damage and save the crop.   The John Conner project provides a timely warning system for farmers when a heat stress event has likely occurred.  We have intergrated data from ABS, BoM and the Qld goverment to inform vegtable growers when they have had a heat stress event so they can inititate remidial action.
