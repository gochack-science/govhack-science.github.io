Check Your Uglies
It's July 31, 2016.  So far this year, 250 women have died from Cervical Cancer and 1500 Men have died from Prostate Cancer.  More than 21000 new cases will be diagnosed by the end of the year.
Accessing cancer screening services is a matter of personal choice, and sometimes it becomes the last choice. Improving cancer outcomes is dependent on the effectiveness of cancer control strategies. Monitoring of cancer control strategies provides the ability to target policy or modify activities to achieve best-practice care, reduce inequalities in cancer control, and ultimately improve cancer outcomes across the population. 
Check Your Uglies is the State of Origin of Cancer Screening.  A global campaign to ensure everyone is screened.  This is how we save lives.
