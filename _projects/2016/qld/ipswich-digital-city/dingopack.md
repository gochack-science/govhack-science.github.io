Our project aims to transform the way people prepare, respond and recover from disasters.  Using our app, you and your family can turn disaster preparation into a fun family activity by preparing your emergency kit, practicing evacuations using customised routes from your location, and setting reminders to update emergency kits regularly.  During a disaster, the app allows you to advise emergency servies that you have activiated your emergency plan and rgister with evacuation shelters.  Once the emergency has passed, you can connect with services and the community to recover in the best possible way.
