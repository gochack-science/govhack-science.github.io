Threat.end is a gamified flora and fauna education and citizen science mobile first web app. 
Threat.end app sources data from, the National threatened animals and ecological species datasets, the Queensland Wildlife database/API, and the Atlas of Living Australia.
Threat.end seeks to educate users in local flora and fauna with a special focus on threated species. The users are rewarded for learning about their locally threatened species and recording sighting via digital capture and release. These sightings are geo-tagged and help build a geospatial map of ecosystems for researchers to further investigate and to help build trending data.
