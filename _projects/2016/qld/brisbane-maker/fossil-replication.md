3d scanning can make objects available to people that they may never be able to inspect in person. Fossils and dinosaur bones are freely available as virtual relics. But humans are tactile, and a model on a computer screen doesn't have the same emotional response as handling a physical object does. 3d printers are now readily available, and are ideal for producing real objects that can provide that tactile response.
