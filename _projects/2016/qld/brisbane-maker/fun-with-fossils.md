This project remixes QLD Museum Ecosciences 3D models of Fossils - Ammonites and Muttaburrasaurus - for 3D printing for use in educational projects, jewelry and crafts. 
I am crew for the Brisbane Maker Node so I am not eligible for local prizes.
I edited and 3D printed these models for my own amusement during quiet times at GovHack and made beads, light up jewelry and brush bots.
Muttaburratorus is a remix of a torus + muttaburrasaurus skull for use in jewelry.
Ammonlite uses the large ammonite model (the top surface is mirrrored and then the model has been hollowed out to make it a complete shell). I used neopixel ring with a Digispark microcontroller and the AdaFruit Neopixel library (using the standard 'strandtest' open source code example) to light up the Ammonlite.
A scaled down (but solid) version of the complete ammonite was used for the beads.
The bot uses the same shell as the ammmonlite, but adds a nail brush, coin cell battery and vibration motor to make a fossil bot.
I had fun with these models. Thanks to the QLD Museum for making them available!
