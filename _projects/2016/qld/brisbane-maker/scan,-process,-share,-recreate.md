Project Description:
We propose an enrichment of existing databases with the addition of 3 dimensional virtual representations of the physical objects.
3D scanned meshes allow interested parties to glean an accurate representation of a public asset's size, structure, surface and shape.
The addition of textures also allows for accurate representation of an objects colour projected onto the 3D mesh. 
Benefits of including scans into data sets include, off site measurements of the virtual object,
the ability to recreate and scale objects using 3D printing and other rapid prototyping technologies.
Virtual objects allow for sharing across distance, display within virtual environments for planning purposes
and the use of virtual reality for education, training and entertainment.
There is a number of collections within museums that could enjoy increased access to the wider public for a multitude of reasons such as:
The object is too fragile to be on display
The object is valuable
The object is too heavy
The object is too big
The collection itself is to vast or distributed geographically
What to Scan
3D scanned collections might include but are not limited to fossils, art, sculptures, plants, artefacts, taxidermy or any other 3 dimensional object.
The existing publicly accessible databases are sparse with most databases not containing even photographs of the object.
The 3D scanning process is cost effective and very accurate if employed correctly.
