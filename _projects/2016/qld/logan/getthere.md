The “GetThere” Concept
 
GetThere is a mobile application to help members of local communities and people new to the area locate services and facilities. It is the answer to show points of interest including bus stops, community services, activities, parks, community groups, and hospitals, with audible and visual directions to the selected locations using maps and directions to public access points.
 
Get there was developed by the CadeeGovHack Group for the GovHack 2016 competition utilizing open data sets from several data locations with the intention of competing for the following prizes: Creative Humanities Hack, Transport data, Age-friendly communities, Getting around Brisbane, Best of Logan, Linking Logan - getting people out of their cars.
