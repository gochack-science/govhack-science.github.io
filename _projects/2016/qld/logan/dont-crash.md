Car crashes are not caused on their own. They are influenced by a number of factors which play an integral role in the severity of the crash.
For GovHack 2016 we have focused on Queensland crash data looking from the perspective of non-controllable aspects such as crashes triggered by animal hits. We have presented the information through a website which aims to inform the general public about areas which have had previous incidences with animals.Â 
We also attempted to link rainfall to crash rates however due to the limitations of the competition, we were unable to further develop the investigation.
