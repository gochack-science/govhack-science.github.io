Commonly we are in favour of tackling the root problem instead of easing symptoms. However, this is what transport is doing for decades. The view has shifted from building more and more infrastructure to using existing infrastructure more efficiently, but it is generally accepted that demand is growing and that it needs to be accomodated. But is this true? Engineers aim to learn from nature and incorporate natural phenomena in projects and one of these phenomena is the natural pulse of a city, area, or region. Travel demand is not a root cause, but simply the result of the need to travel. This project uses open data to explore this need for travel, and aims to find ways to bring our life 'InSync' with the city, area or region we live in.
