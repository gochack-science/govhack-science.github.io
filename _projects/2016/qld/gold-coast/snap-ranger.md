Why not provide extra help to our rangers?
The SNAP RANGER app aims to engage the local community with the Gold Coast wildlife.
Australia is filled with unique animals which many of them can be found on the Gold Coast.Because Gold Coast is one of the most biodiverse cities in Australia and, at the same time, with the highest rates of city growing, the Council has set a Nature Conservation Strategy (2009-2019) focus on preserve the biodiversity and with “conserving the city’s biodiversity and natural assets through Council’s overarching and strong commitment to protecting, managing and restoring a diverse, connected and viable conservation network” as a strategic objective. That is also in accordance with Australia’s Biodiversity Conservation Strategy (2010-2030) which has as priorities Engaging all Australians through mainstreaming biodiversity finding ways to get more Australians to participate in biodiversity conservation and getting measurable results through improving and sharing knowledge.
 The Snap Ranger can be a powerful tool to achieve those goals. The app provides the means to identify and educate oneself about local wildlife whilst enjoying the Gold Coast's scenic nature. Also, it allows you to help our rangers to protect our fauna and flora as the conscience and enjoyment with those natural resources can bring awareness regarding the importance of preserve them. 
Using a digital map on the Snap Ranger app, a user can travel to known locations in the real world to try and find animals whose locations have been recorded by previous government studies.When an animal of significance is located, he can take a photo and log the record. Upload images and complete your understanding of nature on the Coast. The user can also comment on where he discovered the animal to assist future Snap Ranger‘s as well as future government studies. Snap Ranger includes national parks location, endangered animal locations and places where studies have been recorded regarding the environment on the Gold Coast.
For those who love nature, image and the Gold Coast.
For this app, open data from Queensland Government and Gold Coast City Council have been used.
