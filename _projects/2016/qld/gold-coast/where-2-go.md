Power Team has implemented over 20 data sets to provide an all-in-one dynamic app that can be used for any event, tourism agency or local council. The initial concept was based on providing an interactive age-friendly application that is simple enough for any person to use for the Commonwealth Games. This includes transport options and real-time delays data, event locations with geo-pins that provide brief information on events taking place, such as: times and sport being played. ​​​​​​​
After conducting primary research and speaking with local mentors from Government and industry, Team Power decided to increase the functionality of the application to include -
 

Alternate accommodation options utilising data for shared accommodation as most hotels are booked out for the Commonwealth Games


Creative approach to application by providing a visually appealing app that can be used by people of all ages so that they can connect and become socially active by utilising over 15 QLD data sets. These data sets include some of the following-

Local parks 


Amenities


Fitness areas


BBQs


Boating facilities 


Cycleways


Public Showers


Fish Cleaning Areas


Parking Areas


Soft Play Areas for children


Artificial reef locations


 

Real-time risk and crisis data to ensure public safety and help avoid traffic jams and adverse weather conditions ensuring a stream of Fresh Data


Near real-time data for beach users such as sea water temperatures and wave conditions


Events geo-pins utilising Commonwealth Games Locations data sets to demonstrate the viability and use


Back-end administrator system to allow businesses/government to push real-time notifications of emergencies, delays and changes to events to users


Internet of Things innovative approach by using bluetooth geo-proximity sensors so local businesses can offer coupons and special offers to app users, this helps support local business and solves customer traffic and marketing problems faced by small business


Demonstrating the no-boundaries application of the design by utilising transport data across NSW, QLD and VIC to provide users with up to date information on routes and expected delays


Predictive recommendations of events, attractions, dining options and complementary points of interest using a machine learning approach that incorporates perceptrons based on time of day, analysis of the app users facebook profile, age, language and reviews by other users.

 
Future Plans and Commercial Viability
 
Research and advice from mentors has shown that cost of development and cost of upgrades and maintenance is a major concern for Government and industry alike. Our approach to this is to provide a white-label application that is -
 

Fully customisable to suit any business needs


Rebrandable to Government/Event/Business


Increase accessibility by reducing development and upkeep costs, achieves by implementing a subscription model to include maintenance and updates

Redesign the User Interface to create a more visually appealing app
