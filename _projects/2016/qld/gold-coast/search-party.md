What is Search Party?
Search Party is a mobile application that co-ordinates the public in searching for missing persons. GPS tracking is utilized for individuals currently searching for missing persons to generate a 'heat map', which draws attention to areas that have not been recently searched. This app hopes to improve the detection of missing persons by improving the efficiency of volunteers using the app. 
How does it work?
Users will join a search party looking for an individual reported missing in their immediate area. Users can then consult the heat map to view recent search attempts for that person in the area, and use this information to better co-ordinate their search effort i.e. focus on areas that haven't been searched recently. If a missing person is found a user is prompted to call crime stoppers. 
The app uses Government data to retrieve information about missing persons and locations of interest (e.g. Stormwater drains and shelters).
