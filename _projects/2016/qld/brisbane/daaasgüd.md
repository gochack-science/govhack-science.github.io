Data Anonymisation As A S​​​​​​​ervice
Web platform to upload and transform a data set for anonymity.  The user:
1) Uploads their data set
2) Chooses the functions which are applied to this, suppression or generalization
3) Checks the K-Score (to see minimum number of occurrences for unique rows) and downloads the file.  
Able to automatically recognize data types and provide pre-built functions on each data type to suppress/generalize.  
Data sets used were for internal testing/validation purposes.  These were chosen as they provided a good range of data types which we wished to be able to identify and anonymise.
