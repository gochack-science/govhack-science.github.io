What's Up Brisbane aims to address the confusing representation of brisbane events in an easy to use format. By accessing live (with a small delay as it is done by a scheduled job) multiple RSS feeds from Brisbane City Council, an interactive map based format shows a user where events are near them on a specific date. Further work that may not be completed over the weekend included using historical weather and traffic data to estimate future conditions and further filter the suggested events (i.e. to suggest cycling and walking if it's not raining and is nearby and to not suggest outdoor activities when it would be raining etc.).
