If someone doesn't complain, it's easy for us to ignore them. Sometimes we do more. We abuse and take advantage -- particularly if it means we profit, or it's for our own convenience.
If our earth was a human being standing next to us, what would it look like? Would we react and change our behavior, or just turn away ...again?​​​​​​​
Mother Nature is a humanoid art form that exhibits the state of the environment. 
To build it, we looked at science data from the Queensland government including near real-time air quality, emissions from industrial facilities, and waste going into landfill. 
Mother Nature’s lungs visualize the difficulty of breathing in response to the particles that exist within the air. 
The colors at the base of the installation indicate our impact on the earth in terms of heavy metals, dangerous gases, and waste material. 
The humanoid is interactive and allows users to compare data from different locations. Currently, it is displaying data from Brisbane, Mount Isa, and Gladston. Mother Nature is an educational installation that prompts people to consider the state of the environment. By visualizing its impact on human health, the art form makes environmental action urgent.​​​​​​​
