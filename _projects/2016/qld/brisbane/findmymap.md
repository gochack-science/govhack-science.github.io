The Queensland Government made available a collection of digitised topographic maps over Queensland at various scales 1886–2012, which show graphic representations of features including relief, hydrography, vegetation, and cultural. The quality of scans varies. A number of the map series include key maps.

Currently this data is in CSV files which make it very hard to search and view. We are proposing a new interactive web interface where all Queensland Government topographic maps can be viewed and downloaded via a simple web browser interface.
