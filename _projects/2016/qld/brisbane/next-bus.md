Would you use a chainsaw to carve a turkey? Do you go bowling with a bazooka? Are you reading this text in binary? If so, you are probably satisfied with the official Translink app.
Our new tool, ProbablyPivoting, brings you only the most relevant live public transport data, when you want it! The goal of ProbablyPivoting is to provide only the most relevant data in the most minimal user interface. There is no user input required.
It's the right tool for the job.
 
What does it do?
Locates the nearest stops to your location
Gives you the most up-to-date departure times of all SEQ public transport
Saves you time and effort by providing the information on the opening screen
Provides the easiest info for regular public transport users
How does it work?
ProbablyPivoting uses browser based time and geolocation data on your mobile device to determine your current location. It then uses scheduling data from Translink to determine the nearest stop and soonest departing services. A live scheduling feed enables the app to provide up-to-the-minute updates on service delays or cencelations.
 
This app is for those of who have places to be.
