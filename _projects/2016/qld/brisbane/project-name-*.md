Our project focuses on education though visualising government collected data. Our goals are to generate an interface where people can learn about Australia's people, and view information about particular demographics. we also aim to use a neural network to predict the distributions of taxable income for future generations. Because of this; we believe our project is valuable to both education in schools, and identifying the inequalities of Australian people so that these issues can be addressed.
The datasets we used were gathered by the Australian Taxation Office and Australian Bureau of Statistics 2011 census. Programming was done in Python and Matlab.
When used on previous years, our resulting neural network is able to predict the mean taxable income for Australians of various demographics within standard error. This information can be useful to the government to predict future taxable incomes to a high accuracy. Some inequalities by gender and marital status are highlighted by the data. This can be used to combat and educate people about such inequalities. The data also showed a decline in some such inequalities over the years.
