InnovationX is a place to discover the different types of innovation that is happening around us. People are able to see where startup ecosystems are growing; what kind of problems people are solving and the different technologies they are working with; identify gaps and opportunities of the areas, skillsets and technologies that are needed.
InnovationX is 'Connecting Innovation'.
Our goals
For people to know what kind of innovation is happening around them
For people that are working on innovative ideas to showcase and put themselves out there
To connect innovators, people, investors, enterprise and government
To showcase the different problems people are solving, the skills we have a community and the technology we are working with
Identify gaps and opportunities of the kind of skills that are needed; where support can be given; identify naturally growing innovation ecosystems
