When we first heard about Brisbane City Council’s 2031 Vision for an accessible and connected city we knew this was the challenge we wanted to help solve. All of us at Cylindrical Books live within the inner city region and we knew that this vision is what we wanted to see happen in our city. 
Brisbane is an active and vibrant community that is growing every day. We want to share it. We want to make sure that no matter your fitness level, age, or background you are able to take in all that the city has to offer.
We know how hard it is to stay active, especially as young working professionals and students. This is why we created SpokeSocial. SpokeSocial is a cross-platform application that makes utilising active transport easier. It also lets you find events and activities around you on the way, or if you're planning to have a casual cycle. 
Spoke Social knows your form of transport and finds facilities such as bike racks near your destination and routes you to them. If you’re using CityCycle, Spoke Social finds stations along your path, and shows you where to pick up and drop your bike. This is all to make your journey as convenient as possible. Spoke Social also takes your live location data and finds events that are happening nearby.
SpokeSocial does this by integrating live and regularly updated open data such as Council events and kids events, fitness events, active parks, and locations of various facilities.
 
​​​​​​​To use SpokeSocial, head to http://spokesocialapp.com and enter your start and end locations. If you're using your own bike, check the checkbox. Then hit the bicycle icon and it'll calculate everything for you!
SpokeSocial will show your calculated path in two colours; green represents walking and blue represents cycling. SpokeSocial will show you events with red markers, and water fountains with a small "W" icon. The details of the journey are also shown below the map.
The backend is coded with a clean interface that also allows easy importing of new datasets -- any new events or facilities can be added to the app with just a few lines of code.
