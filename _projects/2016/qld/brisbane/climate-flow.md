The Australian Bureau of Meterology maintains almost 18,000 autonomous weather stations around the country, collecting Climate data such as rainfall totals, temperature extrema and windspeeds. Many of the stations have been operational since the late 19th century, so there is a wealth of information about how the climate changes over time in different parts of the country. The information, although technically available to the public, is isolated in separate websites for each station which makes it hard to interpret any useful trends to be found.
We use Python with Bokeh, DataShader, Folium and Leaflet.js libraries to create interactive maps for viewing the BoM data in a web browser. Users will be able to explore the trends in their area of interest, and look for areas with large changes in time.
This could be used for visualizing past data and predicting daily/monthly weather patterns based on past data for various applications:
Farming industry,
Energy (Solar, Wind) industry,
Climate Change Research/Higher Education Industry.
Innovative Visualization Hacks
and so on...
