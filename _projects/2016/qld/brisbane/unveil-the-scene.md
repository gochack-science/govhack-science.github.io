"Unveil the scene" is a web portal that showcases the Australian innovation industry, as well as  the government bodies, private investors and general public who are supporting and growing this diverse industry. In addition to raising public awareness about the extensive work happening in the innovation space, the web portal also aims to promote connections between innovators and their supporters. The start-up and innovation industry of Australia is incredibly important to our future prosperity. However, it includes such a broad range of industries and new ideas, that it is challenging for anyone to fully understand this area - let alone how it can assist them in their everyday lives, and how they can contribute to further growth of Australian innovation.  
Our product helps to 'unveil' the startup and innovation industry - through narrative, data visualisations and custommade recommendation engine.  Leveraging government and industry data, we provide users with a method to explore the startups, the industries, the research community, the investors and government groups.
Additionally, we ask the general public to contribute. By telling us their story, they can help us understand where  innovation can help in their lives. We hope that through this, we can foster an inclusive community, where innovators, researchers and investors can better find new areas of innovation.
