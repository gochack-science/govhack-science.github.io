Project Summary:
The project Australia Go! is designed to assist people to find the best place to live across Australia based on their individual preferences. Moving to another country or city can be stressful. Also, the lack of an integrated tool that can help people make a better decision based on real data adds to challenge. This can have a huge social and economic impact for immigrants and for the community. The Australia Go! project has been defined on two levels State and Region which gives the user the flexibility to rank and compare different states and regions based on a variety of criteria. At the State-level, the user can choose from:
 Cost of living
 Climate
 Employment
 Safety
 Culture
 Education
 Healthcare
 Job opportunities by filed
The user can drill down further details in each field. For example, in the Job Opportunities by Field filter the user can choose from a wide range of jobs and compare different states' opportunities for that job. On the Region-level, they can explore different regions in each state based on their priorities to find the place which best suits them. 
In addition, many possible business ideas can be developed based on this project. For example, for interstate investors who want to buy a real estate property, they may come from NSW and know little about QLD. Therefore, real estate agents are potential clients who can utilise this tool to introduce more personalisation for their customers.
