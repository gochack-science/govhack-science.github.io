Time Walks is a mobile first application making a trip down memory lane easy, enjoyable and interactive. Time Walks couples the accessibility provided by mobile phones and the power of Google Maps and knowledge of local cultural landmarks and conveniences from QLD Cultural and Heritage register, as well as Trove National Library of Australia. 
There is living history all around us. Our rich cultural, social, and economic heritage can be found down our streets, in our parks and public spaces, in buildings, art and monuments.
Our heritage also lives in those of us who are older.  
We all live in the present, yet we carry our “past” selves with us throughout our lives. We are part of a rich history that needs to be shared and preserved. The stories we tell and the trips we take down memory lane remind us of who we are and are an important part our wellbeing. 
 
But there are too many barriers. To engaging with our heritage. To making connections between generations. Barriers to sharing experiences and wisdom. Barriers to getting outside and being active. To enjoying our cities, towns and nature. 
The solution is Time Walks; making a trip down memory lane easy, enjoyable and interactive. Time Walks couples the accessibility provided by mobile phones and the power of Google Maps. 
Trips down memory lane are mapped by unleashing the vast wealth of information held on national and state heritage registers, paired with the locations of local parks and amenities. 
 
Enter a starting point. Select what interests you. It could be heritage, parks or amenities. Add an end point and you’re off on a walk through time. You might be pursuing a personal interest, looking for something to keep the grandkids busy, or just an interesting detour on your walk home from work. 
Detail from the datasets tells you a story on the way and helps you fill in any gaps. Time Walks will give you a new appreciation for the movements and currents that have shaped your world which you may have otherwise just walked past. 
Time Walks let’s you schedule stops at local facilities; to tire the kids out on the swings or make use of the restroom.​​​​​​​
More than just an easy, enjoyable, interactive way to take a trip down memory lane, a Time Walk creates connections. Between people and places. And between generations.  
FutureThe potential of Time Walks is immense, around Australia and the world, only bounded by access to the internet and a register of heritage. 
But even this needn’t be a barrier to future expansion. An ability for communities to create heritage registers of their own will democratise Time Walks as a platform. A Time Walk down the main street of small country town, with references to local events and industries, would prove just as fascinating as anything in our larger centres.
