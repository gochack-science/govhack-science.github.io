Idea: Guiding drivers through dangerous situations via audio
Based on data collected from sensors in the car and open data available externally a current situation of the environment and the mental state of the driver is analysed and depending the analysis result audio feedback is provided to the driver. Audio may include music, noise, or voices. The audio will indicate if the driver is approaching a dangerous situation, influence the mood/state of the driver, e.g., calming down, prevent from falling asleep, pointing out an upcoming dangerous situation.
