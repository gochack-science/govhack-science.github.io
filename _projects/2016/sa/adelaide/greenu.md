Greenu is an interactive poster series that enables people from all ages to learn about public gardens, in a fun and active way. The graphic series works like a scavenger hunt, encouraging people to travel to the posters location in order to scan a QR code that will tell them about a vegetable they can pick in that garden. To bring the idea together, we have used data from Adelaide and Brisbane City Councils, the Bureau of Meteorology, and the Metropolitan Open Space System, whilst also using the ABC coverage of public gardens as a data set and a means for inspiration and encouragement.
The trail begins with the participant arriving at the public garden, greeted by a poster with an environmental message aimed to educate and engage the viewer. Also displayed is a way-finding poster directing them towards the vegetable garden, where they can pick their first vegetable from the trail. Following this,  the participant will scan a graphic poster with a QR code scanner on their phone, which directs them to the next public garden stop. Also provided at the stop is a fold out map, outlining the all the public gardens around the Adelaide area.
The hunt encourages a healthy lifestyle by leading the participant to a corresponding public garden in order to collect the next vegetable in the recipe of that time. By the end of the hunt, the people involved will either have all the ingredients to create a healthy snack/meal, or will have discovered the need for more public gardens & why they can be so important to the community. This not only encourages healthy physical activity, but using the data also educates the player on the current issues and statistics relating to public gardens and Australia water and horticulture. Our project encourages and opens a pathway for community gardens to become a more interactive space in Adelaide, and potentially other cities and destinations around Australia.
By following this fun and rewarding trail you are guided through a story about a different side of Adelaide, bringing awareness to participants that there is a lot to gain from visiting and contributing to such public spaces.
