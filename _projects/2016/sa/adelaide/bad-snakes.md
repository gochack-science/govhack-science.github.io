Board game for upper primary children to explore:
trends in reportable crime rates over time (snakes)
improvements in SASP targets (ladders) 
By playing the game, children (and their parents) can see that
crime rates are trending down not up and they should not be fearful of the community they live in
progress is being made towards SASP targets which is good for the state
A Perl script was written to generate a SVG file for laser cutting a snakes and ladders board on wood. Spreadsheets were used to manipulate the input data to make game cards. In the game when a player reachers the foot of the ladder or the mouth of the snake they pick up a card and read it. They then throw the dice again to pick a year to play for. If it was a bad year they need to throw 6 to escape or advance, if it is a good year just don't throw one. Intermediate years have intermediate difficulty.
