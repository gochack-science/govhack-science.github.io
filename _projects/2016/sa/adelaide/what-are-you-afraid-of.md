Media coverage of events such as terrorist attacks or shark attacks unnecessarily inflates fear and uncertainty in our community.
We aimed to use government data and other online sources to document the probabilities of different types of risks, to show that we don't need to be afraid of these events, and to promote the reality that Australians actually live in a safe community.At the same time, we also like to bring awareness of risks due to factors such as health issues, many of which are things we can proactively prevent by having a healthier lifestyle.
We have created a mobile HTML app:"What are you afraid of?"
“What are you afraid of” uses a variety of data sources to work out what risks affect your demographic, from gender, age groups and location.It attempts to highlight the differences between what you fear and what is likely to affect you - while also providing useful information on how to avoid, deal with or volunteer to help with those risks.
The user is asked to enter their details then clicks spin. They are then presented with a risk randomly chosen, but weighted based on probability from the data. This is combined with a link to educate about the risk.
Then the user is able to compare all the risks that could affect them versus another member of the Australian community. e.g. what are the risk differences between a man and a woman, someone in the city vs someone in regional Australia.
