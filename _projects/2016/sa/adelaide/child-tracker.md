Kid Tracker 
​​​​​​​
The Problem
•       Parents get paranoid when their children do not reach home on time, find out their children are not where they should be…Imagine the stress especially where both parents are working and they discover that their kid is missing or hasn’t reached school or home in time. Also common are the cases of kids getting lost in public places even when parents are around.
 
The Solution
•       What if I say, I can allay this fear by a simple device –“a device “which would give parents alerts/messages about their kids whereabouts during the day.. wouldn’t that be a blessing in this age?
•       The parents can set a radius out of which their child cannot go but in case it happens the parent will get an alert immediately.
