Pathfinder, or Pathfindr as the kids spell it, is an alternative way to find the right course for you at TAFE SA.
Pathfinder replaces search with seek. At TCS we believe in choice, and with Pathfinder we add the ability to browsefor the course that matches you.
By answering a series of questions we narrow down the list of courses provided by TAFE SA from over a thousand, to a manageable number to browse.
 
Note: The working name for the project was Tinder for TAFE which is why it is referred to as such in the video.
