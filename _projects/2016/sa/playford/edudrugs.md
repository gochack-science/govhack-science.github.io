As  parents of a grade 7 child, we wanted to educate them about illicit drugs. We wanted them to know  the names and effects drugs have on your body, and raise their awareness of what is out there in our community. We also wanted them to be able to recognise if anybody they knew was in trouble with drug abuse and where to get help if needed.  
We found it very hard to find any data on drugs that we could discuss with our children. We approached  schools, police stations, hospitals and chemists looking for information. Every person we asked at these locations, reposnded saying such an awareness program would be fantastic. One policeman quoting that if a program could educate our children before high school, he felt he wouldn't see as many children addicted to drugs and so much crime around to pay for drugs.  He said that children as young as 15 were already addidcted, and it only took one hit of ice.  Our concept proposes that a program is initiated in schools or community centres,   making children aware of drugs, and educating them on street names, uses and side effects, similiar to the awareness there is of other health issues such as smoking, alcohol, and sexual education.
As each person told us on our journey to find information, preventing our children from getting involved in drugs in the begininning  is far better than the consquesquences and lifestyle of an addict.
We really need to help our young!!
