Databases are boring, especially when you want to learn about how interesting our local history is using pictures and portraits.
Keeping children interested helps improve educational outcomes.
Historycal Picture Viewer aims to make learning about local history more interesting, by asking interesting questions and finding the resulting stories.
Using State Library of South Australia and National Portrait data, our proof of concept aims to provide a visual, easy to use fun way for children and students to learn about our past.
They can click on a state, and then find historical pictures and the story of those in the pictures, such as "Who played competition violin against adults when only ten years old?"
