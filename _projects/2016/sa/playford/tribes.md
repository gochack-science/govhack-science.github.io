Tribes is an app that uses Geo-Tagging. This app is based off of the 'Pokemon Go'Â engine app, but will make walking fun and educational for students that are on the go. Using GPS signals and Mobile Data, data on Aboriginal Information can just be a walk away from your house. This app was used with Significant South Australian Data and datasets from the Australian Bureau of Statistics.
