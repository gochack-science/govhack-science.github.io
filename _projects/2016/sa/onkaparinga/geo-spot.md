Titled Geo Spot, the application we have proposed is technologically innovative - using a wide variety of local, and state datasets to create an accurate digital map of Australian society. Using this map, we aim to allow people - young and old - to find facilities, create events, and socialise with friends. As a result, Geo Spot is both socially and practically accessible, and can often be found bringing together friends, family, and peers.
 
Designed, created, and published by a non profit organisation, Geo Spot uses an up-to-date and credible group of datasets, while, simultaneously, incorporating information submitted by the surrounding community. This synthesis of organization and community data means our application is constantly and unpredictably evolving through the participation of everyday Australian citizens. Beyond being unique, this community engagement also increases the longevity of Geo Spot’s uptime, making it one of the first, if not the entrepreneur of grassroots, community driven application servers.
 
Furthermore, as well as being beneficial for the community, Geo Spot can also prove helpful for up-and-coming artists, or local businesses. The application’s built-in rating system, photo uploading, and user submitted location data means that Geo Spot can also be implemented as a form of advertisement; an economically friendly alternative to traditional advertising. Additionally, this ability to rate, upload, and submit information also helps highlight local designers, and thus encourage community outreach to significant locations such as monuments, libraries, and buildings.
 
Geo Spot is designed to be many things to equally as many people - but, if anything, we aim to offer versatility: social, economical, and cultural versatility that is rivalled by an application like none other. Geo Spot is a one-of-a-kind application, and is the next step in Australian technological innovation. Now join us, Dunn Street Films, as we enter into this new and exciting stage of technology, and embrace the future that is to come.
 
Welcome to Geo Spot.
