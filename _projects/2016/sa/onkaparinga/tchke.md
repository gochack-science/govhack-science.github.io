The app is about safety. wen You find damage you send evidence to the council to stop dangers in the community.
For example if somebody trips over cracked pavement they can then pin-point the location using the location settings on their device and report the problem back toÂ council automatically.
The app uses Google maps to alert other users to the current incidents in their area and change their travel course if required.
Explanation of data sets used - local council maps etc.
The app will be downloaded by the public becuase of the useful features, then the public will be more inclined to report damages with the app
