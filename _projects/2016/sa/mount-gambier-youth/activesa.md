We’re OutsideIn, a team of students (Brendan Bachmann, 18, Caleb Bachmann, 16, and Jess Leaver, 16) that came together at N3xgen Unleashed 2016 with a vision of making South Australia a better place through data.
Sport has always been a significant part of Australian society, and provides many opportunities for improving health and community participation. However in recent years sport participation has decreased, with an estimated 60% (11.1 million people) over the age of 15 reporting that they had participated in sport and physical recreation at least once during the 12 months prior to 2013–14, compared with 65% in 2011-12 (ABS, 2016). Obesity and its many associated health problems are an ever growing issue, with 63.4% of Australians aged 18 years and over considered obese or overweight in 2015 (ABS, 2015) But what if there was a way to reverse this trend, by helping people to find places to try local sport at a level they’re comfortable with?
Our entry into N3xgen Unleashed 2016 is ActiveSA, an app that aims to be a one stop shop for helping people to connect with local sport in South Australia.
Our app has three major functions: find a sports facility, find a social sport event, and find a sports club. When a user wants to find a sports facility, they are presented with a search page, where they can search a location of their choice or use GPS data. They can then choose their desired type of sport, and click search. This will then generate a list of sports facilities organised by distance, from which the user can select a location, and choose to either navigate there, log a visit, or create a social sport event at the location.
If the user wants to find a social sports event, they again choose a location and sport before searching. This brings up a list of relevant social sporting events that are occurring in their region. The information regarding these events would be user generated, with members of the public able to create an event and link it to social media, helping people get together for fun recreational sporting matches, without the commitment required at a club level.
Finally, if users of the app want to join a sports club, they can tap the sports club button and again search a location and sport. This will bring up a list of local sporting clubs with contact details and locations, helping people to easily take their sport to the next level.
The app is powered by several South Australian datasets, including:
SA Community Services Directory 
Recreational trails
Bike hire locations 
Skate Parks in City of Port Adelaide Enfield
These datasets combine to bring together the information displayed when a user searches within the app. 
The app is designed to help change the trends shown in these datasets:
4102.0 - Australian Social Trends, Jun 2011 - ABS
4364.0.55.001 - National Health Survey: First Results, 2014-15 - ABS
activeSA will help to address the SA strategic plan targets described in these datasets:

SASP Target 82 - Healthy Weight


SASP Target 78 - Healthy South Australians


SASP Target 83 - Sport and Recreation

The app is perfect for both young people and adults, helping them to connect with the level of sport that they want to be involved in. It will also help newcomers to a region connect with sporting locations and clubs quickly and easily.
Our app will help South Australia reach state strategic plan targets, by encouraging more people to participate in sport, and thereby making South Australians healthier and fitter.
It also creates fantastic opportunities to collaborate with private fitness providers and locations, such as gyms, trampolining and rock climbing centres. Major social sports events, such as fun runs could also be incorporated into the app, helping to make these even more successful. In addition, ActiveSA has the potential to be applied at a national level, leading to even more people finding a level of sports participation they enjoy.
This app will improve participation in sports, help bring people together and make South Australia a fitter and healthier state. Thanks for viewing our entry!
