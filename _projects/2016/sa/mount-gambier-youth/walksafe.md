Our project, WalkSafe, is designed to make local travel on foot or on wheels much safer.
It utilises locational crime data sets to create an underlying heat map of crime and uses that map to decide on the safest and quickest route to your destination. 
This idea can easily be taken further by obtaining more specific crime data such as the type of crime, which street the crime was committed on, and who it was committed against (which demographic).
