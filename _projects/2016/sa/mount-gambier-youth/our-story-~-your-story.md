Our Story - Your Story is an interactive choose-your-own-adventure style story coded in html, designed to provide information about a person's local community and bring about a greater understanding of the persons and services within it. It is designed to be a central hub of information presenting data in a relatable and accessible manner, building a sense of community while also opening up discussion and providing information about a variety of social issues and local/online services depending on how the story unfolds.
