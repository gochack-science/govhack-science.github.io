# GovHack 2016 Web Content Guide
This document exists to introduce GovHack Event Hosts and Managers to how GovHack's online presence will be changing in 2016, to help them to take advantage of the changes, and to guide them in getting information published. 

There are two major changes taking place this year:

1. **Revamping our main website at [govhack.org](https://govhack.org/)** with a simpler, cleaner, more modern design, and rewriting and restructing its content to be more accessible to a wider audience.

2. **Launching a new website focused on the competition at [portal.govhack.org](http://portal.govhack.org)** to provide a single place for competitors to find all of the information they need to know (a one-stop shop!) - from the prizes on offer, the available datasets, who's mentoring, and ultimately, the projects that come out of it, and the prize winners.

## What's changing?

In short, we're introducing structure where before there was very little by:

1. **Formalising how we describe and collect information** about events, datasets, prizes, et cetera and storing it in a database.

2. Trying out some new ideas we think will enhance the competition - such as **adding themes, and better supporting challenges/problem statements from sponsors**.

3. Now that everything has a defined structure, we're going to **link it together to make navigating the competition easier** - e.g. Look at a prize and see not only its description, but the datasets and data portals relevant to it, the mentors who are supporting it, and so on.

4. **Creating a showcase that will highlight all of the awesome projects the hackers create**, celebrate the winners, and provide a permanent home for all of the stories and outcomes from GovHack.

5. **Creating attractive marketing pages for each state/region at govhack.org** at govhack.org/nsw, govhack.org/qld, et cetera.

## Why are we doing this?

In short, so we can run GovHack in a leaner and more efficient manner; so we ask less of all of our wonderful volunteers; and to support GovHack to exist all year round, not just as a blip on the year's calendar. 

1. **To give GovHack a permanent home online and to *"collect once, publish multiple times"*.** As GovHack has grown and evolved over the years we've relied on people-intensive and time consuming ways of collecting information from event hosts - often asking for information multiple times, and having it pass through many pairs of hands before it ultimately gets published everywhere it's needed.

2. **To give GovHack a year-round presence and provide a foundation to do more between events to support GovHack projects, and the broader open data mission.** Traditionally GovHack goes quiet between September and March each year, but we've heard a lot of feedback from our community that they'd love support to continue their projects through the year. The first step towards doing that is making sure our online presence enables us to do that. 

3. **To better showcase all of the amazing outcomes of GovHack and follow their stories.** Right now there's no one place to go to see all of the projects that have come out of GovHack, all of the projects from a particular city, all of the projects in a particular broad category - we're fixing that.

## How will hosts and managers make changes?

In short, you'll be using a set of forms we're creating to provide the updates to our new Web Team, and they'll be updating it for you.

To publish *new* information use these links to jump to the forms:

- [State/Region](#stateregion)
- [Events](#events)
- [Sponsors](#sponsors)
- [Prizes](#prizes)
- [Datasets](#datasets)
- [Data Portals](#data-portals)
- [Mentors](#mentors)
- [Themes](#themes)
- [Challenges](#challenges)
- [Winners](#winners)

To *update* information about something that's already published contact [your Digital Producers](#your-digital-producers).

### Why can't we just publish this all ourselves like we used to?

Fair question - and we're planning for that, but this first iteration is very much an experiment and a "[Minimum Viable Product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product)". If everything goes well, and these new ideas work, we'll be investing time after GovHack in creating a user-friendly publishing interface with no technical knowledge required.

### Self-publishing is possible now, but there's a catch

But it requires a bit of technical knowledge and isn't as user-friendly as a [WYSIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) interface you'd find on platforms like Wordpress and Squarespace. If a member of your local team is proficient in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), and has used GitHub's web interface before, then we're more than happy to give them access to the backend of the platform to self-publish.

Get in touch with the Web Team via Basecamp or at [web@govhack.org](mailto:web@govhack.org?Subject=Portal%20GitHub%20Access) for more information.

### Our state/event already has a website

That's great! Actually, quite a few of the ideas we're adopting this year were inspired by things we've seen on GovHack websites created by local event teams. If your team has the capacity and drive to run its own web presence we're fully supportive of that, and will do what we can to help you (e.g. By supplying GovHack digital assets, and a style guide).

**But remember, we'll still need you to list all of the key information about your event (where it is, prizes, datasets, mentors, et cetera) using the forms here so we can publish it in one place.**

## Your Digital Producers
If you have questions about any this, have found a problem, or have a suggestion contact your region's *Digital Producer* on Basecamp or via email.

## Themes
Themes are a new concept for GovHack that will let GovHack (nationally, at the state-level, or for individual events) highlight a few broad high-level themes that emerge as part of the competition.

*For example -* if your local event has a range of sponsors relating to transport you might create a Transport theme around your event that links together the prizes, interesting and useful datasets, related government agencies, and so on.

*For example -* last year the CSIRO put together a dedicated theme website for [GovHack Science](http://govhack-science.github.io/).

*The ultimate decision to create a theme will lay with you as GovHack organisers* looking at a combination of who your sponsors are, what your prizes are, what data sponsors are submitting, and what bounties and challenges sponsors are putting up. Creating themes isn't mandatory, but the GOT team will be here to guide and assist you if you would like to.

In specific cases (such as CSIRO) where a single sponsor represents a broad subject area that's relevant to your prizes, and has super engaged mentors willing to put in the work, they may be given more direct input on the content of the themes.

*We're still working on creating this form - in the meantime place contact [your Digital Producers](#your-digital-producers) to make any changes.*

- *Description:*
  - A few paragraphs introducign and describing the theme
