How can we get people on board with cycleways in this Christchurch. We know, from the research, that people want a greener city that is more pedestrian and cycle-friendly. And we know people are generally supportive of cycle routes until that cycle route impacts on their trees, or their parking, or the way they access their property or business. So how do we get people excited about cycling in this city, so that when the a cycle route comes past their house they can see the bigger picture of what they are gaining, not what they're losing.
