The best hack that assists with identifying and informing the best value for Councils Tree Planting programs. The Urban Forest Strategy expands on the concept of City in a Park, which is focussed on Geelong's CBD, to enhance the public and private tree population in all of the suburbs and townships across Greater Geelong. The sum of all these trees and associated vegetation is called the urban forest. Hacks could include developing a best value tree planting program based on a detailed analysis on priority hotspots for tree planting, defining the progress of the strategy by identifying Geelongâ€™s Coolest Suburb, or what is the coolest way to travel by improving connectivity between green areas to allow people to travel along shadier streets on hot days.
