It is important to identify the relative location of services and facilities used by residents (such as kindergarten, child care, school, work, playgroup, sport & recreation, GP / health practitioners, shopping) with respect to where they live. That is, are members of our community accessing services in their local neighbourhood?  If not, are there patterns of travel?  This will help to identify how services and facilities are being used now and where they need to be located in the future.
