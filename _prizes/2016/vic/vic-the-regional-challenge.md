Hack needs to use datasets from multiple Councils in Victorias south west region. A good hack often covers multiple jurisdictions.  Local Government in the Southwest of Victoria have made a concerted effort to release more open data, but the proof of value is ever present. This presents an opportunity to use common LG data mashed up with State and other datsets to deliver a regional outcome. Anything goes for this Hack.
