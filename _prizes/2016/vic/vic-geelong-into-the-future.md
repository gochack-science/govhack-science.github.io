The best hack that assists with making planning and investment decisions for Geelong over the next 30 years. 
Governments have many options for how places can grow and change. Tough questions need to be answered â€“ should the city grow up or out, which neighbourhoods should change and which areas should stay the same, what services will the future communities need? As Geelong is developing there is a need for long term planning so that government can make smart decisions about how to invest in a sustainable city for years to come. The hack could include information about which areas have the best access to services, which areas are changing over time, which areas have the least restrictions on future development, what should the future city look like, jobs of the future, or future transport services.
