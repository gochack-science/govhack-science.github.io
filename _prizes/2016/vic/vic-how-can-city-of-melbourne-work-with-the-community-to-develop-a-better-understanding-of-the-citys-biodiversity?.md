How can City of Melbourne work with the community to deliver the cityís mission to protect and enhance nature (blue and green ecosystem and biodiversity) in the city, which are vital for the liveability and resilience of Melbourne?
Specifically, how can we foster communityís enthusiasm in urban biodiversity using Melbourne BioBlitz data and empower the community to co-manage the urban nature with us using citizen science?
For instance, can the community help us monitor biodiversity more accurately in a changing climate? Or how can they use the collected biodiversity data for their own daily decision making? Little things like what plant to be planted in their backyard or which local parks/reserves to go this weekend for the most wonderful butterfly watch?
