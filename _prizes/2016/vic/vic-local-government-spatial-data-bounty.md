The Victorian Local Government Spatial Reference Group (LGSRG) would like to encourage Govhack participants to utilise three specific datasets that are published to data.gov.au. The datasets are: 1) Garbage/ rubbish collection rounds ie my rubbish bin night; 2) Playgrounds; 3) Places that I can/ cannot let my dog exercise on/off lead.
The LGSRG is currently running a challenge for all Victorian Councils to publish open data starting with one or all of these datasets. The datasets should be published using the data standards set out under the Open Council Toolkit https://opencouncildata.org/ 
The LGSRG has sponsored a Govhack prize for the best example utilising one or more of these data.

# Prize
Award of cash up to the value of $500

# Eligibility Criteria
Use at least one of the LGSRG priority datasets: 1) Garbage/ rubbish collection rounds ie my rubbish bin night; 2) Playgrounds; 3) Places that I can/ cannot let my dog exercise on/off lead.
