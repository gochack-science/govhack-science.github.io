How might we use data to better track and quantify the flows of waste and  enable better planning and investment? 
As Victoria's population increases, there is greater need to minimise and better manage our waste to create more sustainable communities.  Mapping and quantifying the flows of waste data would provide evidence for forecasting and planning future infrastructure needs for the state. Industry, local and state government would find this particularly useful given the state infrastructure planâ€™s purpose and its influence on determining future waste facilities in Victoria.
