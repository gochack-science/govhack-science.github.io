The City of Melbourne has data that could be helpful for new and existing businesses to make better informed decisions, including data relating to location, new development, pedestrian activity, mobility and leisure. However this information is not readily accessible in a seamless and easily digestible way.
How can the City of Melbourne;
·         Make this data accessible to the business community to inform their strategic decisions regarding location.
·         Improve the way in which City of Melbourne collects information about business activity in the city.
