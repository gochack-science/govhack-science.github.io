How might we use the information from the Family Violence Royal Commission submissions to better understand the factors that will reduce family violence?
Family violence is a major issue in our community.  The Victorian government held a Family Violence Royal Commission.  The Commission released over 200 recommendations.  A number of people and organisations told their story to the commission.  The objective of this challenge to is to find ways of expanding the reach of these submissions and helping to gain better understanding of factors that will reduce family violence.
