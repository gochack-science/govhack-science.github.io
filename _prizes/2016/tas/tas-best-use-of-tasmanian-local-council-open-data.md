Best Use of Tasmanian Local Council Open Data

The best project that uses Tasmanian local council data sets as part of its composition.  The project that wins this category will likely be one with a local focus, that uses local data sets predominantly, but a more broad project that still uses local council data effectively would also be a contender.

# Prize
Award of  $1,000 to the winning team

# Eligibility Criteria
Must use at least one Tasmanian Local Government open datasets.
