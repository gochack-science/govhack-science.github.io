Team Encouragement Award

An award for the team that made a valiant attempt, learnt the most, or is otherwise deserving of further encouragement.  This award will usually go to a junior team (high school or college students), but this isn't a requirement.  It's for the team who has a go and is willing to go out of their comfort zone and try something new, even if it doesn't work out in the long run.
