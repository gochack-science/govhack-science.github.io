The best entry that lifts the mobility barriers throughout the Sydney CBD.
 Currency of data and static paper-based maps lead to poor experience and support to overcome barriers. There are many challenges you could tackle and resolve including; improved enagagment in planning, data collection and distribution, impacts and opportunities for major event planning, enhanced pedestrian/mobility route planning, awareness and future planning to support an aging population that will be faced with mobility challenges. You could also consider a user experience designed mobility barrier mapping that is driven by reliable data.
