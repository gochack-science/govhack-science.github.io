The best use of government data in a hack which educates the community about a topical issue. Ideally your hack should be able to be used to engage and educate school children; other than this, you are limited only by your imagination and your data hacking skills. 

Here are some ideas: (1)Traffic accident statistics could be used to educate people about the dangers of texting and driving. (2) Antarctic measurements, sea temperatures or other data might inform debates about global warming. (3) Health data might be used to highlight the incidence of diseases like melanoma in Queensland.
