The best concept to help your community get to safety during evacuations. Queensland is prone to natural disasters and the decision to evacuate away from a hazard is a critical one. Help disaster managers to better plan for evacuations, and help keep the community aware of what might happen if the evacuation need arises. Communities and disaster managers alike are faced with tough choices including: Which communities might require most help to evacuate? Who needs to go first when there is a need to evacuate? How should I get out?
