OK Tech and Dev Hackers. You've spoken over the years, and we've listened.

We know that sometimes government systems aren't the best things to work with. And we know that most of the time, all of our data is in different formats and sometimes, all kinds of wrong to the professional developer.

So here is your challenge. Make us *"that thing"* we need. The dankest of the dank unofficial APIs. The killer library. The master app. The coolest of the cool. The thing that will solve the *"this is why we can't have nice things"* conundrum.

*"But what makes it cool?"* you ask?

# Prize
Award up to the value of $1,000

# Eligibility Criteria
Entries MUST be cross-team and collaborative.

* Ideally, you'll connect with other techs/devs from other teams and either:
  * Build something that all teams at GovHack can use to discover, access, connect to etc, to multiple agency data portals and websites; or
  * Build something that every Agency at GovHack and elsewhere can use in future years to make it easier for people to do things with our data.
* Entries must be complete and working, open source and available for use, and documented well enough for peer review.
* Demonstrated cross-team use of the working entry will be very highly regarded.

# Judging
By the rules of cool:

* Your peers will be your initial judges - if "that thing we need" is clearly used by a large number of team by the end of the weekend, this will speak for itself and will be very highly regarded for judging - everyone subconsciously knows what's cool and what's not - the inner geek is a powerful judge!
* Agency and Sponsor technical mentors from Service Design and Developer/Coder areas will also evaluate entries on both "big S" service design (is it easy to use, documented, developer experience friendly etc) and code/functional quality.
* The prize will be awarded to the named / significant contributors of the *"thing"*, as if they were a normal team.
