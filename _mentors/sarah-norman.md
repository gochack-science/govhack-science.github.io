Are you looking for a person with a background in projects, programs, customers and innovation? I'm passionate about looking at problems in different ways and challenging the now.  

I've worked in tropical north Queensland, the United Kingdom and south-east Queensland.  I've been responsible for policy development, projects and program management.  My focus now is identifying future trends and making sure we have the strategies to keep up with change.

Department of Transport and Main Roads.
