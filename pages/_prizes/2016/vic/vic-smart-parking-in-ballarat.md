The City of Ballarat is looking at ways to improve parking for residents and people visiting Ballarat. Reasons for requiring parking may vary widely as well as the desired lengths of stay and ways in which citizens may want to engage with parking space. How can we improve parking for our residents? How can we better understand what drives parking behaviours and perceptions around parking? Is there a parking issue in Ballarat? Does the public perception match data available? Information that may come in handy: Data – City of Ballarat data is hosted on www.data.gov.au, with state government information at www.data.vic.gov.au. The ABS also publish information at www.abs.gov.au. Judging for this challenge will be on the concept of your hack. This challenge is not just limited to applications but could be any kind of hack - we will leave that one to you.
