There are many opportunities for residents and visitors of Brisbane to participate in active and healthy pursuits. How can Brisbane make better uses of these and increase the level of participation for all?

Ideas: Help uncover all the active and healthy events and facilities across Brisbane by making them easy
to find, get to and participate in. Or create a game that awards points for participation in active and healthy pursuits and events
encouraging competition against friends, locals or everyone across Brisbane.
