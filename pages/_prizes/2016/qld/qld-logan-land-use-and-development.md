Awarded to the most simple and effective use of freely available information about land use and development. Land Development generates interest, investment, and emotion across many sectors: commercial, political, educational, and personal/citizen. What is being done? Where is it being done? When is it being done? Who is doing it? How is it being done? These questions are asked by residential customers seeking to leverage Logan’s affordable housing options and access to services, networks and facilities; businesses looking to relocate or expand; and investors seeking to identify and rate/compare potential opportunities.
