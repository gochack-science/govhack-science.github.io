The increasing number of people attending the Emergency Department (ED) is not evenly distributed across the population with young adult attendance growing more quickly than other age groups.  Young adults are less likely to need treatment quickly or to be admitted to hospital for further care.  Despite this, when most people are asked they indicate they thought ED is the appropriate place for them to receive care.
