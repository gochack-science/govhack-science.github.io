Entries should seek to not only present data findings but to consider how you want people to respond to the data findings.   A good story sets the scene for the character's and takes us through a plot in a way that engages people with values or emotions.   Stories come in many forms including; art, film, books, journalism and sound.   Some other popular ways of telling stories include comics, game development and digital video.  What story is the data trying to tell you?
