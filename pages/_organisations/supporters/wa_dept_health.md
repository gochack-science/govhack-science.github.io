WA Health is Western Australiaâ€™s public health system. With a State spanning over 2.5 million square kilometres, it is the largest area in the world covered by a single health authority. We employ 43,000 dedicated staff in metropolitan, regional and remote areas of the State to attend to the health needs of our growing population.

In the 2014-15 financial year, we received more than 1,000,000 visits to our emergency departments, performed over 81,000 elective surgeries, conducted 157,000 school dental examinations and delivered services to almost 35,000 new arrivals and their proud parents. We deliver more than hospitals and health services. Our public health programs ensure that Western Australians enjoy a standard of health that is among the highest in the world.
