The WA Housing Authority has developed a model to

estimate demand for social and affordable housing at the LGA level. 
This is a snapshot of unmet demand as of Census night, 2011. 
It is based on data from the 2011 Census, information from the WA Housing Authority, and WA State Government population projections. 
Data from all sources is combined and assessed to produce a priority ranking at the following levels: 
- Pubic Housing, metropolitan area (LGA level) 
- Affordable Housing, metropolitan area (LGA level) 
- Pubic Housing, regional WA (LGA level) 
- Affordable Housing, regional WA (LGA level)

Detailed methodology for the model is shown here in the attached paper
