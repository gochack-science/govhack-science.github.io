AFSA publish a breakdown of business and non-business personal insolvency statistics quarterly for bankrupts, debt agreement debtors and personal insolvency agreement debtors. The time series started in March 2003

<!--more-->

A business related personal insolvency occurs where an individual’s bankruptcy, debt agreement or personal insolvency agreement is directly related to his or her proprietary interest in a business.

The business and non-business personal insolvency statistics may be affected by differences in debtors’ interpretations of what constitutes a business and whether a proprietary interest in a business was the primary cause of insolvency.
