Bankruptcy is a process where people, who cannot pay their debts, become bankrupt to receive the protection of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 and their estate is administered by a trustee. It allows for the fair distribution of property among creditors and the prosecution of dishonest debtors.

Debt agreement is an arrangement between a person who cannot pay their debts and their creditors. It is a formal arrangement under Part IX of the Bankruptcy Act. A debt agreement results from creditors voting to accept a proposal from a debtor to settle their debts. To be eligible to propose a debt agreement, a debtor must be insolvent and meet threshold levels relating to unsecured debts and assets and after-tax income.

Personal insolvency agreement (PIA): under Part X of the Bankruptcy Act, a personal insolvency agreement results from creditors accepting a debtorâ€™s proposal to settle his or her debts. Unlike debt agreements, personal insolvency agreements are not subject to income, asset or debt thresholds.
