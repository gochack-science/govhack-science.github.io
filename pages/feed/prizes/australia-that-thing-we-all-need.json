{"category": "australia", "body": "<p>OK Tech and Dev Hackers. You've spoken over the years, and we've listened.</p>\n\n<p>We know that sometimes government systems aren't the best things to work with. And we know that most of the time, all of our data is in different formats and sometimes, all kinds of wrong to the professional developer.</p>\n\n<p>So here is your challenge. Make us <em>\"that thing\"</em> we need. The dankest of the dank unofficial APIs. The killer library. The master app. The coolest of the cool.
