This challenge is about finding new ways to unlock some of that value without exposing sensitive personal information. One way that this might be done is through de-identification - the release of a modified dataset stripped of any identifying information. But de-identification is hard, and always carries a risk that the data can be combined with other public information sources to re-identify the underlying individuals. Another approach might be to design a system that lets people explore or visualise the data in such a way that information about individuals can never be accessed. Maybe you can think of other approaches. BDM has provided a set of 'dummy data' for you to play with.
