Reasons for requiring parking may vary widely as well as the desired lengths of stay and ways in which citizens may want to engage with parking space. How can we improve parking for our residents? How can we better understand what drives parking behaviours and perceptions around parking? Is there a parking issue in Ballarat? Does the public perception match data available? Information that may come in handy: Data \u2013 City of Ballarat data is hosted on www.data.gov.au, with state government information at www.data.vic.gov.au.
