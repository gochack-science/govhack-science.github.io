Many stations will benefit from multiple trains each hour, where they are serviced by two or more train lines. \nTrams: Trams will operate every 30 minutes on routes 19, 67, 75, 86, 96 and 109. This will provide wide coverage across Melbourne as well as servicing key night-time precincts and the major streets in the CBD grid. \nNight bus network: Night buses will provide a revamped and improved bus service with around 20 overnight routes. The night bus network will have a mix of routes operating from the city, and others providing suburban connections from train stations and suburban night-time hubs. \nV/Line: V/Line coaches will depart from Southern Cross Station around 2am, bound for Bendigo, Ballarat, Traralgon and Geelong.\n"}, "theme": "Spatial Data", "times": {"sunday": {"close": "06:00 PM", "open": "09:00 AM"}, "friday": {"close": "10:00 PM", "open": "06:00 PM"}, "saturday": {"close": "06:00 PM", "open": "09:00 AM"}}, "prefix": "GovHack", "contact": {"website_url": "https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/"}, "location": {"lat": -37.8095156, "lon": 144.9695373}, "eventbrite": "https://govhack_vic_competitor.eventbrite.com.au/", "type": "Theme Node", "id": "melbourne-open-raster", "is_capital_city": true}
