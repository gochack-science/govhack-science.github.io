The Built Environment Inventory data show the accessibility of lifestyle amenities and potential health pitfalls.

They are the result of a research project initiated by Healthy Together Geelong. The data was calculated using a sophisticated, proprietary method by Community Indicators Victoria, McCaughey Centre: VicHealth Centre for the Promotion of Mental Health and Community Wellbeing, Melbourne School of Population Health, University of Melbourne in May 2014.

Distances to many dozens of features as disparate as greengrocers, bus stops, tobacco sellers, and rail trails were calculated from meshblocks of mostly residential populations. These measures were then aggregated and grouped at the neighbourhood level. The table Geelong_BuiltEnvLookup.csv describes the variables and their meanings; these variables make up the GIS file and are also in Geelong_BuiltEnv.csv. In all there are 95 measures recorded for each suburb.
