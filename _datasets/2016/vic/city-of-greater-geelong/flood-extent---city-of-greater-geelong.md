'Flood Extent' shows the extent of the largest recorded historical flood event or estimated 1% Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP) design flood event. Quality of data varies from high quality with floodmapping from detailed flood studies (eg Barwon River) to low quality where flood extent has been estimated subjectively from geological maps (eg Hovells Creek upstream of Lara).
