The Intellectual Property Government Open Live Data (IPGOLD) includes over 100 years of Intellectual Property (IP) rights administered by IP Australia comprising patents, trade marks, designs and plant breeder's rights. The data is highly detailed, including information on each aspect of the application process from application through to granting of IP rights.

IPGOLD is inherently the same data as the IPGOD data set, with a weekly update instead of the annual snapshot available in IPGOD. Many of the scripts of IPGOLD are still being developed and tested. As such IPGOLD should be considered a Beta release.
