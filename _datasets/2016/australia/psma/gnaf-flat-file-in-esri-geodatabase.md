To support GovHack 2016, PSMA has created a simplified GNAF file across a range of common data formats. In response to the feedback received from the general public on the complexity of the full GNAF release on data.gov.au, we have prepared these flat files as an introduction to GNAF. The flat file format makes it easier to use of GNAF, however, in order to create these files, we have had to reduce some capability that was delivered through the complex relational data structure.
