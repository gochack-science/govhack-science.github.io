The Administrative Boundaries datasets are Australia's most comprehensive national collection of boundaries including government, statistical and electoral boundaries.

<!--more-->

Administrative Boundaries is produced by PSMA Australia Limited (PSMA), an unlisted public company formed by the nine governments of Australia to collate and standardise, format and aggregate location data from each of the jurisdictions into authoritative location based national datasets. 

This dataset contains boundaries in seven themes: Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) boundaries, electoral boundaries, state and territory boundaries, local government areas, suburbs/localities, wards and town points.
