The Views of ABC News Digital Content dataset provides both the number of page/screen views per hour for individual pieces of ABC News content and metadata related to each piece of content.  The data is taken from across different ABC digital platforms during the month of May 2016.  These platforms include the ABC News desktop and mobile websites and the ABC app (both iOS and Android versions).

Each piece of content is represented by its ID and is consistent for the same piece of content across platforms.  The URL of the content can be recreated using the platform and this ID.  For example, for the “News” platform and id “7373616”, the URL is retrieved using “http://www.abc.net.au/news/7373616”. The content ID is the key which joins the Traffic data with the Content Metadata.
The data set covers the period from 2016-05-01 00:00:00 to 2016-05-31 23:59:59.
