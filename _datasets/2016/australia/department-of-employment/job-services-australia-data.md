Employment Services is the Australian Governmentâ€™s way of helping get more Australians into work. Job Services Australia was the employment services model between 1 July 2009- 30 June 2015.  These datasets are the aggregated Job Services Australia youth caseload (job seekers aged 15-24) for labour market regions across Australia, broken down by various demographics including stream classification. The caseload datasets contain information on the number of people being assisted by Job Services Australia for each month of the programme.

The outcomes datasets contain information on the number of job seekers who remained in employment for particular milestones (13 weeks or 26 weeks) and who were placed into a job.
