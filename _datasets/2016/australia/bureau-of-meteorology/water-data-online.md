Watercourse level and watercourse discharge time series data from approximately 3500 water monitoring stations across Australia are available.

Water Data Online displays time series data supplied by lead water agencies from each State and Territory with updates provided to the Bureau on a daily basis.

Over time, more stations and parameters will become available and linkages to Water Data Online from the Geofabric will be implemented.
