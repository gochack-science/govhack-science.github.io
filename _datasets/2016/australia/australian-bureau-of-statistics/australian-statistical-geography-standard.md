The ABS provides geospatial web services for the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) regions.

<!--more-->

This includes the ABS Structures, areas defined by the ABS, and Non-ABS Structures, areas not designed by the ABS but approximated using areas from the ASGS Main Structure.

You can find a complete listing of all available services in the [ABS Geospatial Web Services User Guide, 2015](http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/1470.0main+features22015). Supporting documentation is available at the [ABS Geography](http://www.abs.gov.au/geography) page.

__NOTE:__ _There is a known issue with the 2016 Commonwealth Electoral Divisions (CEDs) - due to time constraints, the associated codes are derived from the Australian Electoral Commission. They are not ASGS codes and therefore do not currently align with previous ASGS CED code. This issue will be resolved in an upcoming September release of the product._

It should be noted that areas in the ASGS (and other boundaries) help us group statistical data into understandable areas without compromising privacy and confidentiality.

If you are looking for a way to show where people live (alongside the regions your data maps to), consider using the [Australian Population Grid, 2011](http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/1270.0.55.007main+features12011), our finest level of detail on where Australians live and work.
