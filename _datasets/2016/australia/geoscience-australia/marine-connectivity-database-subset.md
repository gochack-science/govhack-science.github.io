A new fully four-dimensional biophysical dispersal model has been developed by Geoscience Australia, that uses the parallel processing ability of the National Computational Infrastructure Facility supercomputer (http://nci.org.au/), to handle large numbers of simulated larvae, and that can also save supplementary positional information as points within a database management system.

Information gained from the model can be used to inform priorities for monitoring the performance of marine reserves and studying changes in connectivity structure. Other potential applications include the ability to investigate transport patterns of sediment, pollutants or debris; predict the potential spread of invasive species; and quantify how upstream management efforts can generate downstream benefits.
