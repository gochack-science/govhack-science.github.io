GRIM books house national level, historical and recent deaths data for specific causes of death. The tables present age- and sex-specific counts and rates of deaths, and age-standardised death rates, for all causes and for International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th revision (ICD-10) chapters.

GRIM books refer to different years for different causes of death, depending on the data availability, with some GRIM books going back to 1907. They are the only national level electronic source of readily available deaths data for deaths registered prior to 1964. Data from 1964 onwards are sourced from the AIHW National Mortality Database.

Also available on data.gov.au are the AIHW Mortality Over Regions and Time (MORT) books.
