MORT books are Excel workbooks that house recent deaths data for specific geographic areas in a readily accessible and easy to use format. The workbooks present summary deaths statistics by sex for each geographic area, including counts, rates, median age at death, premature deaths, potential years of life lost and potentially avoidable deaths. The workbooks also present leading causes of death by sex for each geographic area.

Most MORT books present data for the last 5 years. Due to changes in geographic classifications over time, long-term trends are not available. Data are sourced from the AIHW National Mortality Database (NMD).

For more information, please see Deaths data at AIHW.

Also available on data.gov.au are the AIHW General Record of Incidence of Mortality (GRIM) books.
