# Your Mentors

GovHack is supported by an awesome group of mentors from a wide range of disciplines who've volunteered to provide assistance to teams. We'll also have mentors who provide insider advice about the datasets (data custodians), and others who have expertise in a wide range of technologies and skills (tech mentors) to help you and your team get the best outcomes possible during the competition.

Check out the [Portal Mentors page](http://portal.govhack.org/mentors.html) for more information on how to get in touch with your awesome mentors.
